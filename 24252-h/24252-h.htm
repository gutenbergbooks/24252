<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>"FOUR YOUNG EXPLORERS" is the third
volume of the third series of the "All-Over-the-World
Library." When the young millionaire and
his three companions of about his own age, with a
chosen list of near and dear friends, had made the
voyage "Half Round the World," the volume with
this title left them all at Sarawak in the island
of Borneo. The four young explorers, as they became,
were permitted to spend three weeks there
hunting, fishing, and ascending some of the rivers,
while the rest of the party proceeded in the Guardian-Mother
to Siam. The younger members of
the ship's company believed they had seen enough
of temples, palaces, and fine gardens in the great
cities of the East, and desired to live a wilder life
for a brief period.</p>

<p>They were provided with a steam-launch, prepared
for long trips; and they ascended the Sarawak,
the Sadong, and the Simujan Rivers, and had all
the hunting, fishing, and exploring they desired.
They visited the villages of the Sea and Hill Dyaks,
and learned what they could of their manners and
customs, penetrating the island from the sea to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the mountains. They studied the flora and the
fauna of the forests, and were exceedingly interested
in their occupation for about a week, when
they came to the conclusion that "too much of a
good thing" became wearisome; and, more from the
love of adventure than for any other reason, they
decided to proceed to Bangkok, and to make the
voyage of nine hundred miles in the Blanchita, as
they had named the steam-launch, which voyage
was accomplished without accident.</p>

<p>After the young explorers had looked over the
capital of Siam, the Guardian-Mother and her consort
made the voyage to Saigon, the capital of
French Cochin-China, where the visit of the tourists
was a general frolic, with "lots of fun," as the
young people expressed it; and then, crossing the
China Sea, made the port of Manila, the capital of
the Philippine Islands, where they explored the
city, and made a trip up the Pasig to the Lake of
the Bay. From this city they made the voyage
to Hong-Kong, listening to a very long lecture on
the way in explanation of the history, manners, and
customs, and the peculiarities of the people of China.
They were still within the tropics, and devoted themselves
to the business of sight-seeing with the same
vigor and interest as before. But most of them
had read so much about China, as nearly every
American has, that many of the sights soon began
to seem like an old story to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing out of the Torrid Zone, the two steamers
proceeded to the north, obtaining a long view of
Formosa, and hearing a lecture about it. Their
next port of call was Shang-hai, reached by ascending
the Woo-Sung. From this port they made an
excursion up the Yang-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tse'">tsze</ins>-Chiang, which was an exceedingly
interesting trip to them. The ships then
made the voyage to Tien-tsin, from which they
ascended by river in the steam-launch to a point
thirteen miles from Pekin, going from there to the
capital by the various modes of conveyance in use
in China. They visited the sights of the great city
under the guidance of a mandarin, educated at Yale
College. Some of the party made the trip to the
loop-wall, near Pekin. Returning to Tien-tsin, with
the diplomatic mandarin, who had accepted an invitation
to go to Japan in the Guardian-Mother, they
sailed for that interesting country, where the next
volume of the series will take them.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to say that the Guardian-Mother,
now eighteen months from New York, and
half round the world, reached Tien-tsin May 25,
1893; and therefore nothing relating to the late war
between China and Japan is to be found in this
volume. Possibly the four young explorers would
have found more sights to see, and more adventures
to enjoy, if they had struck either of the belligerent
nations during the war; but the ship sailed for the
United States before hostilities were begun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the writer has been compelled to consult
many volumes in writing this book; and he takes
great pleasure in mentioning among them the very
interesting and valuable work of Mr. W. T. Hornaday,
the accomplished traveller and scientist, "Two
Years in the Jungle." This book contains all that
one need know about Borneo, to say nothing of the
writer's trip in India among the elephants. His
researches in regard to the orang-outang appear to
have exhausted the subject; though I do not believe
he has found the "missing link," if he is looking
for it. Professor Legge contributed several articles
to "Chambers's Encyclop&aelig;dia," which contain the
most interesting and valuable matter about China to
be derived from any work; for he lived for years in
that country, travelled extensively, and learned the
language. I am under great obligations to these
authors.</p>

<p>The author is under renewed obligations to his
readers, young and old, who have been his constant
friends during more than forty years, for the favor
with which they have received a whole library of
his books, and for the kind words they have spoken
to him, both verbally and by letter.</p>

<h2>FOUR YOUNG EXPLORERS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE BORNEO HUNTERS AND EXPLORERS</h3>


<p>The Guardian-Mother, attended by the Blanche,
had conveyed the tourists, in their voyage all over
the world, to Sarawak, the capital of a rajahship
on the north-western coast of the island of Borneo.
The town is situated on both sides of a river of the
same name, about eighteen miles from its mouths.</p>

<p>The steamer on which was the pleasant home of
the millionaire at eighteen, who was accompanied by
his mother and a considerable party, all of whom
have been duly presented to the reader in the former
volumes of the series, lay in the middle of the
river. The black smoke was pouring out of her
smokestack, and the hissing steam indicated that
the vessel was all ready to go down the river to the
China Sea. Her anchor had been hove up, and
the pilot was in the pilot-house waiting for the commander
to strike the gong in the engine-room to start
the screw.</p>

<p>Just astern of the Guardian-Mother was a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
trim and beautiful steam-launch, fifty feet in length.
The most prominent persons on board of her were
the quartette of American boys, known on board of
the steamer in which they had sailed half round the
world as the "Big Four." Of this number Louis
Belgrave, the young millionaire, was the most important
individual in the estimation of his companions,
though happily not in his own.</p>

<p>Like a great many other young men of eighteen,
which was the age of three of them, while the fourth
was hardly sixteen, they were fond of adventure,&mdash;of
hunting, fishing, and sporting in general. They had
gone over a large portion of Europe, visited the
countries on the shores of the Mediterranean, crossed
India, and called at some of the ports of Burma, the
Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Celebes, and had
reached Sarawak in their explorations.</p>

<p>They had visited many of the great cities of the
world, and seen the temples, monuments, palaces, and
notable structures of all kinds they contain; but
they had become tired of this description of sight-seeing.
When the island of Borneo was marked on
the map as one of the localities to be visited, the
"Big Four" had a meeting in the boudoir, as one of
the apartments of the Guardian-Mother was called,
and voted that they had had enough of temples,
monuments, and great cities for the present.</p>

<p>They agreed that exploring a part of Borneo, with
the incidental hunting, fishing, and study of natural
history, would suit them better. Louis Belgrave was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
appointed a committee of one to petition the commander
to allow them three weeks in the island for
this purpose. Captain Ringgold suggested to Louis
that it was rather selfish to leave the rest of the
party on the steamer, stuck in the mud of the Sarawak,
while they were on the rivers and in the woods
enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>But the representative of the "Big Four" protested
that they did not mean anything of the sort.
They did not care a straw for the temples and other
sights of Siam, Cambodia, and French Cochin-China;
and while they were exploring Borneo and shooting
orang-outangs, the Guardian-Mother should proceed
to Bangkok and Saigon, and the rest of the tourists
could enjoy themselves to the full in seeing the wonders
of Farther India.</p>

<p>It required a great deal of discussion to induce
the commander, and then the mothers of two of the
explorers, to assent to this plan; but the objections
were finally overcome by the logic and the eloquence
of Louis. The Blanche, the consort of the Guardian-Mother,
having on board the owner, known as General
Noury, his wife and his father-in-law, had
nothing to do with this difficult question; but the
general had a steam-launch, which he was kind
enough to grant for the use of the explorers.</p>

<p>The third engineer of the ship was to go with the
quartette, in charge of the engine; five of the youngest
of the seamen were selected to make the venture
safer than it might otherwise have been. Achang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Bakir, a native Bornean, who had been picked up
off the Nicobar Islands, after the wreck of the dhow
of which he had been in command, was to be the
guide and interpreter.</p>

<p>The youngsters and their assistants had taken
their places on board of the "Blanchita," as Louis
had christened the craft, and she was to accompany
the two large steamers down the river. But the
farewells had all been spoken, the hugging and
kissing disposed of, and the tears had even been
wiped away. The mothers had become in some
degree reconciled to the separation of three weeks.</p>

<p>The Guardian-Mother started her screw, and began
to move very slowly down the river, amid the cheers
and salutations of the officers, soldiers, and citizens
of the town. The Blanche followed her, and both
steamers fired salutes in honor of the spectators to
their departure. The Blanchita secured a position
on the starboard of the Guardian-Mother, and for
three hours kept up a communication with their
friends by signals and shouts.</p>

<p>Off the mouth of the Moritabas, one of the outlets
of the stream, the steamers stopped their screws, and
the "Big Four" went alongside of the Guardian-Mother;
the adieux were repeated, and then the
ships laid the course for their destination. Both of
the latter kept up an incessant screaming with their
steam whistles, and the party on board of them
waved their handkerchiefs, to which the "Big Four,"
assisted by the sailors, responded in like manner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
while the engineer gave whistle for whistle in feeble
response.</p>

<p>When the whistles ceased, and the signals could
no longer be seen, the Blanchita came about, and
headed for the Peak of Santubong on the triangular
island formed by the two passes of the Sarawak
River. The explorers watched the ships till they
could no longer be seen, and then headed up the river.</p>

<p>"Faix, the bridges betune oursels and civiloization
are all broke down!" exclaimed Felix McGavonty,
who sometimes used his Milesian dialect in order,
as he put it, not to lose his mother's brogue.</p>

<p>"Not so bad as that, Felix; for there is considerable
civilization lying around loose in Borneo," replied
Louis Belgrave.</p>

<p>"Not much of it here is found," added Achang
Bakir, the Bornean.</p>

<p>"Is found here," interposed Morris Woolridge,
who had been giving the native lessons in English,
for he mixed with it the German idiom.</p>

<p>"Rajah Brooke has civilized the region which he
governs, and the Dutch have done the same in portions
of their territory. Professor Giroud gave us
the lecture on Borneo, and we shall have occasion to
review some of it," added Louis. "But I think we
had better give some attention to the organization of
our party for the trip up the Sarawak River."</p>

<p>"I move, Mr. Chairman, that we have the same
organization we had on board of the Maud," interposed
Felix, dropping his brogue. "That means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that Mr. Scott shall be captain, and Morris mate,
while Louis and myself shall be the deck-hands."</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, I move an amendment to the motion,
to the effect that Louis shall be captain, while
I serve as deck-hand," said Scott.</p>

<p>"I hope the amendment will be voted down, and
that the original motion will prevail," Louis objected.
"Captain Scott, in command of the Maud,
on a voyage of two thousand miles, proved himself
to be an able and skilful commander, as well as a
prudent and successful leader in several difficult situations.
He is the right person for the position.
Question! Those in favor of the amendment of
Mr. Scott will signify it by raising the right hand."</p>

<p>Scott voted for his own motion, and he was the
only one.</p>

<p>"Contrary minded, by the same sign," continued
Louis, raising his right hand, Felix and Morris voting
the same. "The amendment is lost. The question
is now on the original motion of Felix. Those
in favor of its adoption will signify it."</p>

<p>Three hands appeared, the motion was carried,
and the chairman informed Scott and Morris that
they were chosen captain and mate. Scott was outvoted,
and he made no further objection. Of the
five seamen on board he appointed Pitts cook and
steward, in which capacity he had served on board
of the Maud. The starboard is the captain's watch;
though the second mate, when there is one, takes his
place for duty, and the port is the mate's watch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I select Clingman for the first of my watch,"
continued Scott. "Your choice next, Morris."</p>

<p>"Wales," said the mate.</p>

<p>"Lane for the starboard," added Scott.</p>

<p>"Hobson's choice," laughed Morris, as he took
the last man. "Clinch for the port; the last, but
by no means the least."</p>

<p>"I fancy the watches will have an easy time of
it; for I suppose we shall not do much running up
and down these rivers, and through dark forests, in
the night," suggested Louis.</p>

<p>"If we lie up in the night, I shall divide them
both into quarter-watches, and have one man on
duty all the time; for we may be boarded by a huge
crocodile or a boa-constrictor if we are not on the
lookout. But Achang is a pilot for these rivers.
Isn't that so, Captain Bakir?"</p>

<p>"I have been up and down all the rivers in this
part of the island, though I was not shipped as a
pilot then," replied Achang, who had been the captain
of a dhow, and on board the ship he had been
called by his first name or the other with the title.</p>

<p>"All right; we shall use you for pilot or interpreter
as occasion may require; and I suppose you
can tell us all we want to know about the country
and the people," added the captain.</p>

<p>Clinch, one of the ablest seamen on board, was
steering the launch, and Scott kept the run of the
courses; but as long as the craft had three feet of
water under her, she was all right. The conversation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
took place in the cabin, as the explorers called the
after part of the steamer, though no such apartment
had been built there.</p>

<p>A frame constructed of brass rods, properly
braced, extended the entire length of the launch.
A stanchion at the bow and another at the stern,
with five on each side set in the rail, supported a rod
the whole distance around the craft. Another extended
from the bow to the stern stanchion, directly
over the keel, about six inches higher than those at
the sides. Ten rods led from the central down to
the side rods, like the rafters of a house.</p>

<p>Over the whole, of this structure above was extended
a single piece of painted canvas, serving as a
roof, and keeping out both sun and rain. It was
laced very taut to the rods, and had slope enough to
make the water run off. On the sides were curtains,
which could be hauled down tight. The launch had
been used by the rajah on the Ganges, and when
closed in the interior was like "a bug in a rug."</p>

<p>Thus closed in, the standing-room was called the
cabin. It was surrounded by wide cushioned seats,
which made very good beds at night. Between these
divans was a table where the meals of the explorers
were to be served. Under the seats were many
lockers for all sorts of articles, the bedding, and the
arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>Just forward of the cabin were the engine and
boiler, with bunkers on each side for the coal. In
the middle of the craft was abundant space. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
forward part of the boat was provided with cushioned
divans, where passengers could sit by day or
sleep at night; and this space was appropriated to
the sailors. In the centre of it was the wheel.
Next to it was the galley, with a stove large enough
to cook for a dozen persons, and all needed utensils.</p>

<p>The ship's company had looked the craft over
with great interest, and all of them were well
pleased with the arrangements. The launch had
been put into the water and fitted up for use the
day before. The party from both ships had visited
her, and almost wished they were to go to the interior
of the country in her.</p>

<p>The Blanchita continued on her course up the
river. Pitts was at work in the galley; and as soon
as the launch was made fast off the "go-down," or
business building of the town, dinner was served to
the seamen, and later to the denizens of the cabin.
The afternoon was spent in examining the place,
and in obtaining such supplies as were needed; for
the boat was to sail on her voyage up the river early
the next morning.</p>

<p>With the assistance of Achang, a small sampan, a
kind of skiff, was purchased; for the Bornean declared
that it would be needed in the hunting excursions
of the party, for much of the country was
flooded with water, a foot or two in depth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>A VOYAGE UP THE SARAWAK RIVER</h3>


<p>The young hunters slept on board of the Blanchita,
and they were delighted with their accommodations.
Sarawak, or Kuching, the native name of
the town, is only about one hundred and fifty miles
north of the equator, and must therefore be a very
warm region, though away from the low land near
the sea-coast it is fairly healthy. The party slept
with the curtains raised, which left them practically
in the open air.</p>

<p>Achang had given them a hint on board of the
ship that mosquitoes were abundant in some localities
in Borneo. The Guardian-Mother was provided with
the material, and the ladies had made a dozen mosquito
bars for the explorers. They were canopies,
terminating in a point at the top, where they were
suspended to the cross rods on which the canvas roof
was supported. The netting was tucked in under the
cushions of the divan, and the sleepers were perfectly
protected.</p>

<p>Captain Scott had carried out his plan in regard
to the watches. The cook was exempted from all
duty in working the little steamer; but each of the
other seamen was required to keep a half-watch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
two hours during the first night on board. Clinch
was on watch at four in the morning. He called the
engineer at this hour, and Felipe proceeded at once
to get up steam. It was still dark, for the sun rises
and sets at six o'clock on the equator.</p>

<p>As soon as there was a movement on board, all
hands turned out forward. There were no decks to
wash down; and, if there had been, the water was
hardly fit, in the judgment of the mate, for this purpose,
for it was murky, and looked as though it was
muddy; but it was not so bad as it appeared, for the
dark color was caused by vegetable matter from the
jungles and forest, and not from the mud, which
remained at the bottom of the stream.</p>

<p>"The top uv the marnin' to ye's!" shouted Felix,
as he leaped from his bed about five o'clock,&mdash;for all
hands had turned in about eight o'clock in the evening,
as the mosquitoes, attracted by the lanterns,
began to be very troublesome,&mdash;and the Milesian
could sleep no longer.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Flix?" demanded
the captain.</p>

<p>"Sure, if ye's mane to git under way afore night,
it's toime to turn out," replied Felix. "Don't ye's
hear the schtaym sizzlin' in the froy'n pan?"</p>

<p>"But it isn't light yet," protested Scott.</p>

<p>"Bekase the lanthern in the cab'n bloinds your
two oyes, and makes the darkness shoine broighter
nor the loight," said Felix, as he looked at his
watch. "Sure, it's tin minutes afther foive in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
marnin'. These beds are altogidther too foine,
Captain."</p>

<p>"How's that, Flix?" asked Scott, as he opened the
netting and leaped out of bed.</p>

<p>"They're too comfor-<i>ta</i>-ble, bad 'cess to 'em, and
a b'y cud slape till sundown in 'em till the broke o'
noight."</p>

<p>"Dry up, Flix, or else speak English," called Louis,
as he left his bed. "There is no end of 'paddies'
along this river, and I'm sure they cannot understand
your lingo."</p>

<p>"Is it paddies in this haythen oisland?" demanded
Felix, suspending the operation of dressing himself,
and staring at his fellow deck-hand. "I don't belayve
a wurrud of ut!"</p>

<p>"Are there no paddies up this river, Achang?"
said Louis, appealing to the Bornean.</p>

<p>"Plenty of paddies on all the streams about here,"
replied the native.</p>

<p>"And they can't oondershtand Kilkenny Greek!
They're moighty quare paddies, thin."</p>

<p>"They are; and I am very sure they won't answer
you when you speak to them with that brogue,"
added Louis.</p>

<p>"We will let that discussion rest till we come to
the paddies," interposed the captain, as he completed
his toilet, and left the cabin.</p>

<p>By this time all the party had left their beds and
dressed themselves; for their toilet was not at all
elaborate, consisting mainly of a woollen shirt, a pair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of trousers, and a pair of heavy shoes, without socks.
Felipe had steam enough on to move the boat; and
the seamen had wiped the moisture from all the
wood and brass work, and had put everything in
good order.</p>

<p>"Are you a pilot for this river, Achang?" asked
Scott, as the party came together in the waist, the
space forward of the engine.</p>

<p>"I am; but there is not much piloting to be done,
for all you have to do is to keep in the middle of the
stream," replied the Bornean. "I went up and down
all the rivers of Sarawak in a sampan with an English
gentleman who was crocodiles, monkeys, mias,
snakes, and birds picking up."</p>

<p>"Wrong!" exclaimed Morris. "You know better
than that, Achang."</p>

<p>The native repeated the reply, putting the verb
where it ought to be.</p>

<p>"He was a naturalist," added Louis.</p>

<p>"Yes; that was what they called him in the
town."</p>

<p>"I think we all know the animals of which you
speak, Achang, except one," said Louis. "I never
heard of a mias."</p>

<p>"That is what Borneo people call the orang-outang,"
replied the native.</p>

<p>"Orang means a man, and outang a jungle, and
the whole of it is a jungle man," Louis explained,
for the benefit of his companions; for he was better
read in natural history than any of them, as he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
read all the books on that subject in the library of
the ship. "In Professor Hornaday's book, 'Two
Years in the Jungle,' which was exceedingly interesting
to me, he calls this animal the 'orang-utan,'
which is only another way of spelling the second
word."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Louis, but I think we will get under
way, and hear your explanations at another time,"
interposed Captain Scott.</p>

<p>"I have finished all I had to say."</p>

<p>"Take the wheel, Achang," continued the captain.</p>

<p>The sampan was sent ashore to cast off the fasts.
The river at the town is over four hundred feet
wide, and deep enough in almost any part for the
Blanchita. As soon as the lines were hauled in, the
captain rang one bell, and Felipe started the engine.
The helmsman headed the boat for the middle of the
stream, and the captain rang the speed-bell. When
hurried, the Blanchita was good for ten knots an
hour, but her ordinary speed was eight.</p>

<p>On the side of the river opposite Kuching, or Sarawak,
was the kampon of the Malays and other natives;
and the term means a division or district of
a town. Many of the natives of this village had
visited the Blanchita,&mdash;some for trade, some for employment,
and some from mere curiosity. None of
them were allowed to go on board of the launch; for,
while the Dyaks are remarkably honest people, the
Malays and Chinese will steal without any very
heavy temptation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Achang headed the boat up the river. For five
miles the banks were low, with no signs of cultivation,
and bordered with mangroves. At this point
the captain called Lane to the wheel, with orders to
keep in the middle of the river. The "Big Four"
had taken possession of the bow divans, the better
to see the shores. They were more elevated, which
simply means higher above the water.</p>

<p>"When shall we come across the paddies, Achang?"
asked Felix; "for I am very anxious to meet them,
and maybe we shall have a Kilkenny fight with
them."</p>

<p>"No, you won't, for you speak English," replied
Louis.</p>

<p>"The paddies are here on both sides of the river,"
added Achang.</p>

<p>"I don't see a man of any sort, not even a Hottentot,
and I am sure there is not a Paddy in sight."</p>

<p>"Your education has been neglected, Flix, and you
did not read all the books in the ship's library," said
Louis. "I only told you the paddies would not answer
you if you spoke to them with a brogue. You
can try them now if you wish."</p>

<p>"But I don't see a single Paddy to try it on."</p>

<p>"Here is one on your left."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything but a field of rice."</p>

<p>"That's a paddy in this island."</p>

<p>"A field of rice!"</p>

<p>"Achang will tell you that is what they call them
in Borneo."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bad luck to such Paddies as they are! But it
looks as though there might be some Paddies here,
for the houses are very neat and nice, just as you see
in old Ireland."</p>

<p>"Certainly they are; but I never saw any such in
Ireland," added Louis. "You remember the old
woman on the road from Killarney to the lakes who
told us she lived in the Irish castle, to which she
pointed; and it looked like a pig-sty."</p>

<p>"Of course it didn't have the bananas and the
cocoanut-palms around it."</p>

<p>"I admit that we saw many fine places in Ireland,
and very likely your mother lived in one of them.
But, Achang, is there any game in the woods we see
beyond the paddies?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes there is plenty of it; at others there
is scarcely any. You can get squirrels here and
some birds."</p>

<p>"Any orang-outangs?"</p>

<p>"We found none when we came up the river, for
this is not the best place for them. If we run up
the Sadong and Samujan Rivers, you will find
some," replied the Bornean. "I don't think it will
pay to go very far up the Sarawak, if it is game you
want; but you can see the country. There is quite
a village on the right."</p>

<p>The party were very much interested in examining
the houses they saw on the borders of the
stream. Like those they had seen in Java and in
Sumatra, they were all set up on stilts. A Malay or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Dyak will not build his home on dry land, as they
noticed in coming up the lower part of the river,
though there was plenty of elevated ground near.
The dwellings were all built on the soft mud.</p>

<p>The village ten miles up-stream was constructed on
the same plan. The houses were placed just out of
the reach of the water when it was higher than usual.
The material was something like bamboo, as in India,
with roofs of kadjang leaves, which abound in
the low lands. In front of every one of them was a
flat boat&mdash;sampan; and one was seen which was
large enough to have a roof of the same material as
the house. The boats were made fast to a pole set in
the mud.</p>

<p>"There is a bear on the shore!" shouted Morris,
with no little excitement in his manner, as he pointed
to the woods on the shore opposite the houses, to
which the attention of all the rest of the party had
been directed.</p>

<p>At the same time he seized his repeating rifle, and
all the others followed his example. The animal
was fully three feet high, and at a second glance it
did not look much like a bear. Whatever it was, it
took to its heels when the sound of the steamer's
screw reached its ear. But Morris fired before the
boat started, and the others did the same.</p>

<p>"That is not a bear, Mr. Morris," interposed
Achang, laughing as he spoke.</p>

<p>"What is it, then?" demanded Morris.</p>

<p>"A pig."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"A pig three feet high!" exclaimed the hunters
with one voice.</p>

<p>"A wild pig," added the Bornean.</p>

<p>"Is he good for anything?" inquired Scott.</p>

<p>"He is good to eat if you like pork."</p>

<p>"He dropped in the bushes when we fired. Can't
we get him?" asked Morris.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the captain the steamer
was run up to the shore; and the bank in this place
was high enough to enable the party to land without
using the sampan. All hands, including the seamen,
rushed in the direction of the spot where the pig
had been seen. The game was readily found. The
animal was something like a Kentucky hog, often
called a "racer," because he is so tall and lank.
He was a long-legged specimen; and Achang said
that was because they hunted through swamps and
shallow water in search of food, and much use had
made their legs long. He added that they were a
nuisance because they rooted up the rice, and farmers
had to fence their fields.</p>

<p>He was carried on board by the sailors, and Pitts
cut out some of the nicer parts of the pig. They
had roast pork for dinner, but it was not so good as
civilized hogs produce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT BORNEO AND ITS PEOPLE</h3>


<p>"I don't think we know much of anything about
Borneo," said Scott, as the Blanchita continued on
her course up the Sarawak, after the dinner of roast
pork.</p>

<p>"We all heard the lecture of Professor Giroud on
board the ship," replied Louis.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear it over again, now that we
are on the ground," added the captain.</p>

<p>"Sure, we're not on the ground, but on the
wather," suggested Felix.</p>

<p>As the reader did not hear the lecture, or see it
in print, it becomes necessary to repeat it for the
benefit of "whom it may concern." The professor,
after being duly presented to his audience in Conference
Hall, proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Australia is undoubtedly the largest island in
the world, and some geographers class it with the
continents; but Chambers makes Borneo the third
in size, while most authorities rate it as the second,
making Papua, or New Guinea, the second in extent.
Lippincott says Papua disputes with Borneo the
claim to the second place among the great islands of
the world; and I do not propose to settle the question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Chambers gives the area of Borneo at 284,000
square miles, the population in the neighborhood of
200,000, and the dimensions as 800 by 700 miles.</p>

<p>"It has a coast-line of about 3,000 miles, nearly
the whole of which is low and marshy land. A
large portion of the island is mountainous, as you
may see by looking at the map before you;" and
the professor indicated the several ranges with the
pointer. "One chain extends nearly the whole
length of the island, dividing in the middle of it
into two branches, both of which almost reach the
sea on the south. Near the centre of the island
are two cross ranges, one extending to the east, and
the other to the south-west. It would be useless to
mention the Malay names of these ranges, for you
could not remember them over night. The general
idea I have given you is quite enough to retain.</p>

<p>"The interior of Borneo is but little known; and
when Mr. Gaskette makes another map of the island
twenty or thirty years hence, it will probably differ
considerably from the one before you. In the extreme
north is the peak of Kini Balu, the height of
which is set down at 13,698 feet, with an interrogation
point after it. Other mountains are estimated
to be from 4,000 to 8,000 feet high. There are no
active volcanoes.</p>

<p>"In the low lands on the coast, it is hot, damp, and
unhealthy for those who are not acclimated; but in
the high lands among the mountains, the temperature
is moderate, from 81&deg; to 91&deg; at noon, and it is sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
worse than that in New York. From November
to May, which is the rainy season, violent storms
of wind with thunder-showers prevail on the west
coast. In hot weather the sea-breezes extend a considerable
distance inland. Vegetation is remarkably
luxuriant, as our young hunters will find in their
explorations. The forests produce all the woods of
the Indian Archipelago, of which you know the
names by this time. Brune&iuml;, on the north-west
coast, produces the best camphor in Asia, which is
about the same as saying in the world."</p>

<p>"What is camphor, Professor?" asked Mrs. Belgrave.
"I have used it all my life, but I have not
the least idea what it is."</p>

<p>"Camphor is an oil found in certain plants, mostly
from the camphor laurel. This oil is separated from
the plant, and then undergoes the process of refining.
It is mixed with water, and then boiled in a sort of
retort. It makes steam, which is allowed to escape
through a small aperture, which is then closed, and
the camphor becomes solid in the upper part of the
vessel. This is the article which is sent to market.</p>

<p>"All the spices and fruits of the Torrid Zone are
produced in Borneo, with cotton and sugar-cane in
certain parts. The animals of the island are about
the same as in other parts of the Archipelago. The
monkey tribe is the most abundant, including the
simia, the gibbon, the orang-outang, found in no
other island, except very rarely in Sumatra, where
our hunters did not find even one; tapirs"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked Uncle Moses.</p>

<p>"They are a sort of cross between an elephant and
a hog. They are found all over South American
tropical regions and in this part of Asia. The animal
is more like a hog than like an elephant, though
it has the same kind of a skin as the latter. It is
about the size of the average donkey. It has a snout
which is prehensile, like the trunk of an elephant,
but on a very small scale.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Mrs. Blossom.</p>

<p>"Capable of taking hold of anything, as the elephant
does with his proboscis. The tapir is one of
the gentler animals, and may be easily tamed; though
it will fight and bite hard when attacked, or harried
by dogs. They take to the water readily, though the
American swims, while the Asiatic only walk on the
bottom. One book I consulted calls the tapir a kind
of tiger, to which he bears hardly any resemblance.</p>

<p>"The other animals are small Malay bears, wild
swine, horned cattle, and puny deer. The elephant
and rhinoceros are found, few in number, in the
north. The birds are the eagle, vulture, argus-pheasant,&mdash;a
singular and beautiful bird,&mdash;peacocks,
flamingoes, and swifts."</p>

<p>"What in the world are swifts?" inquired Mrs.
Woolridge.</p>

<p>"They are a kind of swallow, of which you may
have seen some as we came down from Rangoon.
They make the edible birds'-nests which are so great
a delicacy among the Chinese when made into soup.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The rivers, lakes, and swamps swarm with crocodiles,
the real man-eaters. Leeches are a nuisance when
you bathe in the rivers and ponds, and various kinds
of snakes abound. There are plenty of fish in the
sea, lakes, and rivers. Diamonds, gold, coal, copper,
are mined in the island.</p>

<p>"All of New England and the Middle States, with
Maryland, could be set down in Borneo, still leaving
a considerable border of swamp and jungle all around
them. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland could be slapped down upon it like a flapjack,
and there would still be more than space for
another United Kingdom, without covering up all the
mud of Borneo. We do not see how big it is when
we look on the map.</p>

<p>"The larger portion of the island is included in
the Dutch possessions. Banjermassin, of which
something was said as we passed the mouth of the
Barito River, on which it is located, contains 30,000
inhabitants, and is the most important in the island.
Borneo proper is in the north-west, and is under the
government of the Sultan of Brune&iuml;. He lost nearly
one-half of his territory, taken by the North Borneo
Company, and that in the west, which is now Sarawak,
of which I shall have something more to say
later. The island of Labuan lies six miles west of
the northern portion of Brune&iuml;. It was ceded to
the English by the sultan, and is principally valuable
as a coaling-station, though it has a considerable
trade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sabah is the country of the North Borneo Company.
An American obtained the right to this
territory in 1865, and transferred it to the present
company. It has an area somewhat larger than the
State of Maine. No doubt they will develop and
improve the country.</p>

<p>"Sarawak has a territory nearly as large as that
of the State of Pennsylvania, and larger than the
State of Ohio. Its history is involved in the life
of Sir James Brooke, who was originally created the
rajah, or governor of the country, by the Sultan of
Brune&iuml;, and retained the title till his death in 1868.
He was born in Benares in 1803, and educated at
Norwich, England. In 1819 he entered the East
Indian army, and was severely wounded in the Burmese
war. He returned to England; and his furlough
lapsed before he could rejoin his regiment,
and with it his appointment. He left the service.
He next conceived a plan for putting down piracy
in the Indian Archipelago, and of civilizing the savage
inhabitants of these islands, a grand and noble
scheme to be carried out by a single individual on
his own responsibility.</p>

<p>"He bought a small vessel, and made a voyage
to China, probably with the intention of improving
his finances for the work he had in view. In 1835
he inherited $150,000 at the death of his father.
After a cruise in the Mediterranean, he sailed in a
schooner-yacht from London for Sarawak, where he
arrived in 1839. The uncle of the sultan was engaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in a war with some tribes of rebels, and
Brooke rendered him important assistance. He
returned to Kuching with the title of rajah, his
predecessor, a native, having been compelled to
resign.</p>

<p>"The new governor immediately went to work
very vigorously to establish a better government,
introducing free trade, and framing a new code of
laws. At this time the atrocious custom of head-hunting
prevailed in the island. Enemies killed in
battle were decapitated simply for the sake of the
head, and the Dyak who obtained the greatest
number of them was esteemed the most valiant
warrior.</p>

<p>"A Dyak girl would not accept the addresses of
a young man who had not obtained a head, in the
earlier time; and murders were often committed for
the sole purpose of obtaining the head of the victim,
either to conciliate some dusky maiden, or as a
trophy for the head-house, of which there is one
in every village. The heads were 'cooked,' as they
called it, though the operation was merely drying
and cleaning the skull. Rajah Brooke made the
penalty of this kind of murder death, without regard
to the customs and antecedents of the natives; and
he soon abolished head-hunting in his dominion.</p>

<p>"The sultan, either directly or by 'winking at it,'
encouraged piracy; and the crime was as common as
in the vicinity of the Malay states fifty years ago.
Sir James Brooke resolutely attacked the pirates,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and with the means at his command soon vanquished
and drove them from the sea and the land. The
Dyaks, in spite of their head-hunting propensities,
were rather a simple people; while the Malays of
the island were cunning, dishonest, treacherous, and
cruel. The simple Dyaks were no match for them,
and were cheated and abused in every possible way.
There was no such thing as justice in the land. The
new rajah corrected all these abuses.</p>

<p>"Having established his government on the basis
of right and justice to all, Brooke went to England
in 1847. He was invited to Windsor by the Queen,
and created a K. C. B. (Knight Commander of the
Bath), a distinguished honor in Great Britain. The
next year he was made governor of Labuan. He
was charged in the House of Commons with receiving
head-money for pirates killed; but the charge
was disproved.</p>

<p>"Brooke continued to hold his position as Rajah of
Sarawak while at Labuan; but in 1857 he was superseded
at the latter, and returned to his government.
The Chinese, of whom there are a great many in
Borneo, became incensed against him because he prevented
the smuggling of opium into his territory. A
large body of them attacked his house in the night,
and destroyed a great amount of his property.</p>

<p>"But the rajah was not a man to submit quietly
to such an outrage. He immediately collected a
force of Dyaks and Malays, and attacked the Celestials.
He razed a fort they had constructed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
thoroughly defeated them in several successive battles.
He was very prompt and decided in action,
and to see an abuse was to remedy it without unnecessary
delay. He established and maintained a
model government, and the country prospered greatly
under his mild but decisive rule.</p>

<p>"He found a town with 1,000 inhabitants, and left
it with 25,000. He died in 1868, and was succeeded
by his nephew, Sir C. T. Brooke, who extended his
territory, and ten years ago placed it under the protection
of the United Kingdom. This is the history
of a noble man and a model colony."</p>

<p>"But what are Dyaks, Professor?" inquired Mrs.
Belgrave.</p>

<p>"They are natives of Borneo, though all the people
are not known by this name. They are divided
into Hill Dyaks and Sea Dyaks. At the present
time they are a high-toned class of savages; for they
do not steal or rob, and they have many social virtues
which might be copied by the people of enlightened
nations. Head-hunting and piracy are known
among them no more. They are the farmers and
producers of the island. There is much that is very
interesting about them. They build peculiar houses,
some of them occupied by a dozen or more families,
though they always live in peace, and do not quarrel
with their neighbors. The young women select their
own husbands, and a head is no longer necessary to
open the way to an engagement.</p>

<p>"If any of the party wish to learn more of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Dyaks, their manners and customs, present and past,
you will find a work in two volumes, by the Rev.
J. G. Wood, entitled, 'The Uncivilized Races of
Men;' and you will find that the author often
quotes from Rajah Brooke."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A SPECULATION IN CROCODILES</h3>


<p>The Blanchita continued on her course up the
river with Clingman at the wheel. There was no
table in the fore cabin; and the dinner of the six
men, including the engineer, was served astern after
the "Big Four" had taken the meal. Louis attended
to the engine while Felipe was at his meals
and occasionally at other times. A table is not a
necessity for the crew of a ship, and one is not used
on board a merchant vessel; but Louis insisted that
all hands should fare equally well on board of the
little steamer.</p>

<p>The dinner was disposed of, and Wales was at the
wheel. The men had nothing to do, and a couple of
them had assisted Pitts in washing the dishes and
putting the after cabin in order. It was an idle
time, and the "Big Four" were anxious to have
something more exciting than merely sailing along
the river, the novelty of which had worn off; and
they had not long to wait for it.</p>

<p>"A crocodile ahead, Captain, on the port bow,
sir!" exclaimed Wales, the wheelman, whose duty
required him to keep a sharp lookout for any obstructions
in the stream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>All of the party had their weapons within reach,
including the three seamen who were disengaged;
but the latter were not expected to use the rifles
till they were ordered to do so by the captain or
any one of the hunters. The occupants of the fore
cabin, the principal personages on board, had the
exclusive use of the forward part of the boat, though
the hands were at liberty to use the seats when they
were not required by any of the "Big Four." No
order to this effect had been given; but the men,
under the influence of the discipline on board of
the ship, had involuntarily adopted the system.</p>

<p>"Slow her down, Wales," said Scott, after he had
observed the situation of the saurian.</p>

<p>The wheelman rang the jingle-bell, and the boat
soon came down to half-speed. The five hunters,
including Achang, had their rifles ready for use,
though they still retained their seats. The reptile
was not asleep; and he appeared to have some
notions of his own, for he was not disposed to wait
for the coming of the boat. He settled down in the
dark water so that he could not be seen, but the
surface was disturbed by his movements.</p>

<p>"Port the helm, Wales," said the captain quietly.
"He is going across the river."</p>

<p>Presently he came to the surface again, and was
swimming towards the opposite shore. He kept his
head and a small portion of his back next to it above
the surface of the water, as the young hunters had
seen in Sumatra before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Full speed; give her a spurt, Wales," said the
captain.</p>

<p>The wheelman rang the speed-bell, and then spoke
through the tube to the engineer. The boat suddenly
darted ahead under this instruction, and was
soon abreast of the reptile, who was not at first
disposed to change his tactics. He evidently realized
that he was pursued, and it seemed to make
him angry.</p>

<p>"The rascal has put his helm to port," said Wales.</p>

<p>"Look out there, in the waist!" shouted Scott to
the seamen, a couple of whom were seated on the
rail, with their legs dangling over the side of the
boat. "Never sit in that way, men, unless you
want to be carried to the hospital with a leg bitten
off."</p>

<p>"Will they bite, Captain?" asked Clinch.</p>

<p>"Bite? They are regular man-eaters on these
rivers."</p>

<p>"I used to go in swimming with the alligators on
the Alabama River; but they all kept their distance,"
added the seaman.</p>

<p>The two men drew in their legs and moved inboard.
Alligators, which are generally considered harmless
in the rivers of the Southern States, will bite at anything
hanging in the water. As Wales had suggested,
the crocodile had changed his course, and was now
headed directly for the Blanchita. He seemed to
have concluded that there was no safety for him in
flight, and he had decided to fight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your first shot, Louis," said Scott, who had not
even taken up his rifle, as if he thought there would
be no chance for him after the millionaire had fired.</p>

<p>Louis waited a minute or more till he could distinctly
see the eye of the crocodile, and then he fired.
As has so often been said before, he had been thoroughly
trained in a shooting-gallery, and was a dead
shot, as he had often proved during the voyage.
The bullet had evidently gone to his brain, for the
reptile floundered about for an instant, and then
moved no more. As Felix put it, he was "very
dead," though the word hardly admits of an intensifier.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with him now?" asked
the Milesian.</p>

<p>"I don't think we want anything more of him;
but, like a poison snake, he is a nuisance that ought
to be abated," replied the captain. "I dare say the
rajah will be much obliged to us for making the
number of them even one less."</p>

<p>"How long is he?" Achang inquired, as he returned
his rifle to its resting-place.</p>

<p>"About ten feet," replied Louis.</p>

<p>"More than that," the captain thought. "I should
say twelve feet."</p>

<p>"Then he is worth eighteen shillings to you," added
the native.</p>

<p>"What is he good for, Achang?" asked Morris.</p>

<p>"He is good for nothing," replied the Bornean.
"The crocodile here eats men and women. Some are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
killed every year, and the government pays one and
sixpence apiece for the heads."</p>

<p>"That looks like a war of extermination upon
them," said Morris.</p>

<p>"I don't know what that is; but they want to kill
them all off," replied Achang, who had improved his
language so that his tutor seldom had to correct it.</p>

<p>"That is the same thing. They pay by the foot
for crocodiles here."</p>

<p>"The bigger they are, the more dangerous," suggested
Louis. "Let us haul him alongside, and see
how long he is."</p>

<p>The boat had stopped her screw before Louis
fired; and the captain directed Wales to lay her
alongside the saurian, which was done in a few
minutes. Ropes were passed under his head and
tail; and with a couple of purchases made fast to
the horizontal rods over the rail, close to the stanchions,
the carcass was hoisted partly out of the
water. The measure was taken with a line first, to
which Lane, who was a carpenter's assistant, applied
his rule, which gave twelve feet and two inches as
the length of the crocodile.</p>

<p>"That makes him worth eighteen shillings," said
Achang.</p>

<p>"About four dollars and a half," added Morris.
"We could make something hunting crocodiles. If
we could kill ten of them like that fellow it would
give us forty-five dollars."</p>

<p>Louis and Scott laughed heartily at this calculation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and thought the idea was derogatory to the
character of true sport, though they did not object
to turning their victims of this kind into money.</p>

<p>"Must we carry the carcass of this beast down
to Kuching in order to get the reward, Achang?"
asked Morris.</p>

<p>"The head will be enough; and they can tell how
long he is by the size of it."</p>

<p>"How shall we saw the head off? Can you do it,
Lane?"</p>

<p>"I can do that," interposed the Bornean, as he
went to a bundle of implements he had procured in
the town and from the natives.</p>

<p>He drew from it a very heavy sword, from which
he took off the covering of dry leaves, and applied
his thumb to the edge of the weapon. Then he
picked out a straw from some packing, and dropped
it off in pieces, as one tries his razor on a hair. It
appeared to be as sharp as the shaving-tool, and he
was satisfied. All hands watched his movements
with deep interest. He secured a position with one
foot on the side of the boat, and the other on the
back of the crocodile. With two or three blows of
his sword, he severed the head from the body, and
a seaman secured it with a boathook.</p>

<p>All hands applauded when the deed was done, as
the Bornean washed his keen blade. The operation
excited the admiration of all the lookers-on, it was
so quickly and skilfully done. Louis wished to examine
the weapon, and it was handed to him. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was heavy enough to require a strong arm to handle
it; and it was sharp enough for a giant's razor, if
giants ever shave, for most of them are pictured
with full beards.</p>

<p>"I suppose this is a native's sword," said Louis,
as he passed it to the captain.</p>

<p>"Dyak <i>parong latok;</i> <i>parong</i> same thing, not so
long," Achang explained.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is what the Dyaks used when
they went head-hunting," said Felix.</p>

<p>"No head-hunting now; used to use it, the Hill
Dyaks. Used in battle too; split head open with it,
or cut head off."</p>

<p>"What other weapons did the fighting men use?"
asked Louis.</p>

<p>"They carried a shield, and used a spear with
the parong latok; no other weapons. Two kinds of
Dyaks, the Sea and the Hill."</p>

<p>While the native was talking, the seamen, by order
of the captain, had hoisted the head of the saurian
into the sampan towing astern, placing it on a piece
of tarpaulin. The carcass was cast loose, and probably
was soon devoured by others of its own kind.</p>

<p>"We might find some eggs in the crocodile," said
Achang, as the body floated past the boat.</p>

<p>"We don't want the eggs," replied the captain,
turning up his nose.</p>

<p>"Good to eat, Captain. My naturalist used to
eat them. Very nice, like turtles' eggs, which Englishmen
always put in the soup."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"None in my soup!" exclaimed Scott, with a wry
face, to express his disgust.</p>

<p>"I suppose they would be all right if we only got
used to them," suggested Louis.</p>

<p>"As the man's horse did when he fed him on shavings,"
sneered Scott.</p>

<p>"I did not take very kindly to turtles' eggs when
we were in the West Indies; but I got used to them,
and then liked them," added Louis. "In Africa the
natives eat boa-constrictors, and think they are a
choice morsel. Some of our Indians eat clay, and
I suppose they like it."</p>

<p>"Something up in the trees yonder, Captain,"
said Wales, as the boat approached some higher
ground, which was not overflown with water, as
most of the shore below had been.</p>

<p>"Monkeys," added Achang, not at all excited.</p>

<p>"I don't think I care to shoot monkeys unless it
is for the purpose of examining them," said Louis.
"They are too small game, and they are harmless
creatures."</p>

<p>"Strange monkeys in here," continued Achang.
"Not these," he added when he had obtained a sight
of one of them. "These no good."</p>

<p>All eyes were directed to the tree; and at least a
dozen common monkeys were there, such as they
had seen in the museums at home. The steamer
continued on her course, and a couple of miles farther
on the forest was inundated. Some of the trees
appeared to be inhabited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Plenty of elephant monkeys in here," said
Achang.</p>

<p>"Elephant monkeys!" exclaimed Louis. "I never
heard of any such animals. Are they called so because
they are so large?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Achang; "because they have such
long noses."</p>

<p>"There are a dozen monkeys in that tree, and
they look very queer," said Louis, as he elevated
his double-barrelled fowling-piece, loaded with large
shot, and fired.</p>

<p>One of them dropped, and another when he discharged
the second barrel. The boat was run in the
direction of the tree till it grounded in the mud.
The captain proposed to go for them in the sampan,
when Clingman volunteered to wade to the tree for
the game, and soon returned with the two victims of
the millionaire's unerring aim. They were placed in
the waist, and all were curious to see them. The
rest of the tribe scampered away over the tops of the
trees, crying, "honk, honk, kehonk!"</p>

<p>"They are proboscis monkeys, and old males at
that; for they have very long noses, which is the
reason for the name, and why Achang calls them
elephant monkeys," said Louis, as he turned the
creatures over. "The noses of these two reach
down below the chin. They stand about three feet
high, but are rather lank, like the tall pigs."</p>

<p>While the party were examining them, the captain
gave the order to back the boat, and then to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
ahead. She was moored for the night soon after.
The next morning, by the advice of Achang, the
Blanchita was headed down the river, for the native
declared that they would find no different game on
the banks of the Sarawak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>A HUNDRED AND EIGHT FEET OF CROCODILE</h3>


<p>The party were stirring as soon as it was daylight;
for in the tropics the early hours are the pleasantest,
and they had fallen into the habit of early rising in
India. The trees were alive with monkeys of several
kinds, though the proboscis tribe seemed to be in the
majority. Felix came out of the cabin with his gun
in his hand, and began to regard the denizens of
the tree-tops with interest.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Flix?" asked Louis,
who was sitting on the rail, busily cutting out a notch
in the end of a long piece of board.</p>

<p>"Don't you see there is plenty of game here, my
darling?" demanded Felix, pointing up into the
trees.</p>

<p>"Game!" exclaimed Louis contemptuously.
"Monkeys!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you shoot a couple of them yesterday
afternoon, Louis?"</p>

<p>"I did; but I wanted them in order to study the
creature. Now every fellow knows what a proboscis
monkey is, as he did not before except by name. I
got my books out, and read him up with the animal
before me. I am glad I did; for the picture of him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
I had seen was nothing like him in his nasal appendage,
which gives him his name."</p>

<p>"What is the reason of that?"</p>

<p>"The portrait was taken from a young one, before
his nose had attained its full growth. But I don't
believe in shooting monkeys for the fun of it. Our
party are not inclined to eat them."</p>

<p>"I'd as soon eat a cat as a monkey," added Felix.</p>

<p>"Then, don't shoot those long-nosed fellows, for
we have all the specimens of them we need," said
Louis.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with them, my darling?
You can't keep them much longer, and you will have
to throw them overboard, for they won't smell sweet
by to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Achang learned something about taxidermy from
the naturalist he travelled with, and he has promised
to skin and mount one of them for me."</p>

<p>"But what's that you are making, Louis?" asked
Felix, who had been trying to take the measure of
the implement the young Cr&#339;sus was fashioning.</p>

<p>Its use was not at all evident. A triangular piece
had been sawed out of the end of a strip of board four
inches wide, and the rest of it had been cut down and
rounded off, and the thing looked more like a pitchfork
than anything else.</p>

<p>"Is it to pitch hay with?" persisted Felix.</p>

<div class='right'><a href="#Page_41"><i>Page 41.</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>"No, it is not; when you see me use it, you will
know what it is for. You must wait till that time
before you know," replied Louis, who appeared to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
have finished the implement just as the other brought
his gun to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"That's the handsomest schnake I iver saw since
me modther, long life to her, left ould Ireland before
I was bahrn."</p>

<p>"Don't shoot him, Flix!" protested Louis vigorously.
"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Jist forninst the bow of the boat. Sure, Oi'm
the schnake-killer of the party, and he's moi game."</p>

<p>"I don't want him killed yet," replied Louis, as he
moved forward from the waist with the forked stick
in his hand. "He is handsome, as you say, Flix."</p>

<p>Creeping very cautiously till he could see over the
bow, he discovered the serpent, which was nearly six
feet long, working slowly down a dead log towards
the water. Springing to his feet on the bow, he
struck down with his weapon, directing the fork at
the neck of the reptile. The outside of the log was
nothing but punk, or the operation would have been
a failure. As it was, the two points of the implement
sunk into the wood, and the snake was pinned in the
opening at the end of the stick.</p>

<p>"What have you got there, Mr. Belgrave?" asked
Achang, hurrying to the side of the operator.</p>

<p>"A snake; do you know him?" demanded Louis,
as the reptile struggled to escape.</p>

<p>"I saw one like it years ago;" and he gave a long
Dyak name to it which the others did not understand.
"Wait a minute or two, and I will bring him on
board for you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know that we want him on board," added
Louis.</p>

<p>"He is not poison, and he won't hurt you," said
the Bornean, as he made a slip-noose at the end of a
piece of cord.</p>

<p>Hanging over the bow, he passed the noose over
the head of the snake, and hauled it taut, and then
made the end he held fast to the boat. Louis lifted
his implement from the neck of the snake, and he
squirmed and wriggled as though he "meant business."
Achang leaped to the shore, and seizing the
serpent by the tail, tossed him into the boat. He
struck on one of the cushions, and the cord prevented
him from going any farther.</p>

<p>Scott and Morris had just reached the fore cabin at
this moment, and they started back as though they
had been bitten by the snake. His head, tail, and
belly were bright red, with white stripes upon a dark
ground along his back and sides. No one but Achang
had ever seen such a serpent, even in a museum. His
snakeship was disposed to make himself comfortable
on the cushion, and the Bornean loosed the cord
around his neck.</p>

<p>"I saw a small snake, not more than two feet long,
swimming near the shore of Lake Cobbosseecontee, in
Maine, that had nearly all the colors of the rainbow
in his skin," said Morris. "I tried to knock him
over with my fishing-rod, and catch him; but I
failed. I told the people where we boarded about
him, but no one had ever seen a snake like him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are plenty of such snakes in South America,
some that are not poisonous, which the native
women tame and wear as necklaces," added Louis.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do with him?"
asked Captain Scott. "I think you had better kill
him, and throw him into the river, pretty as he is.
He isn't a very desirable fellow to have as a companion
on board."</p>

<p>"What is the use of killing him? He would only
be food for the crocodiles," protested Louis.</p>

<p>"Do what you like with him, Louis," added the
captain.</p>

<p>"I certainly will not have him killed. If Achang
never saw but one of the kind, there cannot be a
great many of them in this part of the island. Put
him ashore, Achang," said the humane young gentleman.</p>

<p>The Bornean complied with this request; and the
handsome snake skurried off in the woods, none the
worse for his adventure. But the others were not
quite satisfied with the policy of the young millionaire.
They wanted to shoot whatever they could
see in the nature of game, including monkeys, and
he was opposed to this destructive action. Of course
they could kill whatever they pleased, but the moral
influence of the real leader prevailed over them.</p>

<p>"Steam enough!" shouted Felipe from the engine.</p>

<p>"Take the wheel, Clingman, back her out and go
ahead," said the captain; and in a few moments they
were steaming down the river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you haven't any tenderness for crocodiles,
have you, Louis?" inquired Scott, with a smile.</p>

<p>"You seem to believe that I am as chicken-hearted
as a girl; but I believe in killing all harmful animals,
including poisonous snakes; but I do not like
to see these innocent monkeys shot down for the fun
of it," replied Louis. "You can kill them if you
choose, but I will not."</p>

<p>"The rest of us will not, if you are opposed to it,"
added Scott.</p>

<p>"Crocodile on the port hand!" exclaimed Clingman.
"He is swimming across the river, about
three boats' lengths from us."</p>

<p>"Stop her!" said the captain.</p>

<p>"I shot the last one, and I will not fire at this
one," added Louis, who was not disposed to monopolize
the fun.</p>

<p>"All right; then I will be number two, Morris
three, Flix four, and Achang five; and if you are all
satisfied, we will fire in this order hereafter," continued
Scott, as he took aim at the saurian.</p>

<p>He missed the eye of the reptile, and the bullet
from the rifle glanced off and dropped into the
water.</p>

<p>"How many shots is a fellow to have before he
loses his chance?" asked the captain, as he aimed
again.</p>

<p>"I suggest three," said Louis. "Those in favor of
three say ay."</p>

<p>They all voted "ay," and Scott fired twice more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
"Your turn, Morris;" and he appeared to be very
much chagrined at his ill luck. "I could hardly see
the eye of the varmint."</p>

<p>Morris fired his three shots with no better success.
Felix took a different position from the others, placing
himself on the stem. He fired, and the saurian
still kept on his course. He did better the second
time; and the reptile floundered for a moment, and
then turned over dead. The boat was run up alongside,
and Achang was required to bring out his parong
latok, with which he decapitated the game at a
single blow this time; but the creature was only nine
feet long.</p>

<p>Pitts called the cabin party to breakfast at this
time. The Blanchita went ahead again, and the
repeating rifles were left on the cushions. At
Louis's suggestion the captain gave the four men off
duty permission to use the arms on crocodiles, but
not on monkeys.</p>

<p>Ham and eggs, with hot biscuit and coffee, was the
bill of fare; and the young men had sharpened their
appetites in the sports of the morning. Before they
were half done they heard the crack of a rifle. They
listened for the second shot, but none followed it.</p>

<p>"Who fired that shot, Pitts?" asked the captain,
as the steward brought in another plate of biscuit.</p>

<p>"Clinch, sir," replied the man. "He knocked the
crocodile over at the first shot, sir."</p>

<p>"Then he is a better shot than I am," said Scott,
laughing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or any of the rest of us who had their turns,"
added Felix. "Louis is the only fellow that brings
'em down the first time trying."</p>

<p>"The rest of you would have done better if the
sun had not reflected on the water, and shaken your
aim," said Louis.</p>

<p>Before the meal was finished, another shot was
heard, followed by two more. When the party went
forward they found that the little steamer had gone
around a bend so that the forest shaded the surface
of the water. Wales had fired the last three times
at a crocodile still in sight; but he declared that he
could not hit the side of a barn twenty feet from him,
and did not care to fire again. The men went to
breakfast, and the cabin party picked up the rifles.
It was Achang's turn; and he missed twice, but killed
the game at the third shot.</p>

<p>"I can see four more of them. We seem to have
come to a nest of them, and the family are out for
a morning airing," said Louis, as he picked up his
rifle, while Felix was filling the other chambers with
cartridges. "They have all started to go across the
river."</p>

<p>"That must be the father of the family at the
head of the procession," added the captain. "It is
your turn now, Louis."</p>

<p>"Go ahead a little, Pitts," said the next one in
turn; for the cook had taken the wheel while Clingman
went to his morning meal. "I can't see his eye
yet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will do; stop her. I can see his eye now,
and there is no reflection on the water."</p>

<p>As soon as the boat lost her headway, Louis fired.
The saurian leaped nearly out of the water, and came
down wrong side up. There were three dead reptiles
lying on the water. It was the captain's next
shot, and when he placed the yacht in a position to
suit him he fired. The crocodile lifted his head out
of the water, and did not move again.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Captain!" cried Louis. "You did not
have a fair chance last time, and you have redeemed
yourself."</p>

<p>"I thought I could shoot better than before, and
now I feel better. But there are two more, and your
turn, Morris."</p>

<p>He killed the game with the third shot, and Felix
finished the last in sight with the second. Achang
had brought out his formidable weapon, and the six
dead reptiles were decapitated. The last three killed
were each nine feet long, while the one Louis had
shot was fourteen. The heads were all put in the
sampan, and they made a full load for it. The Blanchita
arrived at Kuching early in the afternoon, and
the chief of police measured the heads, and took the
figures from Felix. He made one hundred and eight
feet of crocodile, which the official approved as correct,
and paid not quite forty dollars for the bounty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE VOYAGE UP THE SADONG TO SIMUJAN</h3>


<p>The money received for the heads of the crocodiles
was in the hands of Felix, who was the clerk of the
captain on board the ship, and it was proper to make
him purser of the Blanchita. What to do with it
was the next question. Louis's advice was asked
for, and he promptly suggested that it should be
divided into ten parts, and a share given to all but
himself; and this was done. He refused to accept a
penny, but all the others received about four dollars
apiece.</p>

<p>The money was all in silver, as it is all over India
and the Archipelago for general use. The engineer
and the seamen shared with the four hunters; for the
former had done all the work and some of the shooting.
The steamer was made fast at the shore, and
all hands except Pitts landed for a walk through the
town. Their first visit was to a fruit-store kept by
a Chinaman; and most of the shops in the place were
in the hands of the Celestials.</p>

<p>Bananas and oranges were the principal, though
there were also nearly all the tropical fruits in season.
Many of the party purchased useful articles in
other places. They had learned in Singapore and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Batavia how to deal with Chinese traders, and they
seldom gave even more than one-third or one-half of
what was demanded. After diligent search Achang
found a certain Dyak tool he wanted,&mdash;a sort of axe,
which Lane, the carpenter's assistant, ridiculed without
mercy.</p>

<p>The young men visited the English Mission, where
they were kindly received, and went to the school.
The American missionaries are also active in Borneo,
and one of them has made a vocabulary of the Dyak
language.</p>

<p>It was decided to start down the river the next
morning on the way to the Sadong and Simujan
Rivers, the latter being a branch of the former. In
the early morning, as the hands were casting off the
fasts, two Malays came alongside in a sampan, and
asked to be towed to the Sadong. Achang had some
talk with them, and made the request of the captain
for them. He learned that they were engaged in the
business of catching crocodiles for the reward.</p>

<p>"They don't shoot crocodiles, and they have no
rifles," added Achang.</p>

<p>"How do they get them then?" asked Louis.</p>

<p>"They fish for them."</p>

<p>"What, with a hook and line?" demanded Captain
Scott.</p>

<p>"With a line, but have no fish-hook," replied the
Bornean. "You must see them catch one."</p>

<p>"All right," replied the captain; "we will tow
them down the river."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>After the yacht had been moving about an hour,
they came to a colony of saurians apparently, for
several of them were in sight at once. Achang directed
the reptile-hunters to catch one of them, and
they paddled their sampan towards a large one. The
Blanchita kept near enough to enable all hands to
witness the operation, which the Bornean described
to them as the Malays made their preparations, for
they had all their fishing-gear in their boat.</p>

<p>The line they used was a rattan about forty feet
long. At the "business end," as Scott called it, they
attached a float to keep it on the top of the water.
The steamer just crawled along on the river in order
not to disturb the game, though the reptiles were
accustomed to the sight of vessels.</p>

<p>"Now you see that stick the hunter has in his
hand," said Achang, though each of them had one.
"'Most a foot long, like a new moon."</p>

<p>"Crescent-shaped," added Louis.</p>

<p>"Called an <i>alir</i> in Malay. Made of green wood,
very tough, pointed at the ends; they fasten the
rattan line to the middle of the stick."</p>

<p>Some tough green bark, braided together, was then
wound around the stick so that the game could not
bite it in two. A big fish for bait was then attached
to the alir, and carefully fastened to it so that the
reptile could not tear it off.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, the apparatus was thrown overboard,
and the sampan paddled away from it to give
the game an opportunity to approach it, the Malays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
each paying out his forty feet of line, one on each
side of the boat. The spectators watched the result
with great interest. As the sampan receded from
the saurians, they approached the bait. Crocodiles
and alligators do not nibble at their prey, but bolt
it as a snake does a frog.</p>

<p>The bait nearest to the observers on the yacht was
soon gobbled up by the hungry crocodile, who appeared
not to have been to breakfast that morning;
and the Malay at the other end of the line gave a
sharp jerk to his gear, the effect of which was to
draw the pointed crescent "athwart ships," as the
sailors would say, or across his stomach; and the
harder it was pulled the more the pointed ends would
penetrate the interior of the organ.</p>

<p>The first Malay had hardly hooked his game before
the second had another ready to haul in. Both of
the saurians struggled and lashed the dark water into
a foam; but both of the men in the sampan kept the
line as taut as they could with all their strength; and
this is the rule in hauling in all gamey fish.</p>

<p>"Tell them we will go ahead, Achang, and all they
need to do is to make fast their rattans to the sampan,"
said Captain Scott, when he had taken in the
situation.</p>

<p>In reply to the message the Bornean delivered to
them, the Malays nodded their heads vigorously, and
smiled their assent.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, down the river, Clinch," added the captain
to the helmsman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fancy there will be a lively kick-up on the part
of the game," said Louis, as the boat came up to her
course.</p>

<p>"Not much," added Scott. "If we put them
through the water at the rate of eight knots an
hour, the crocs will not feel much like doing any
gambolling. We are not making more than four
knots now."</p>

<p>"They are as lively now as a parched pea in a
hot skillet."</p>

<p>"I will ring the speed-bell now, and see how that
will affect them," replied the captain, suiting the
action to the word.</p>

<p>The Blanchita darted ahead at her usual speed.
Clingman began to overhaul the painter of the sampan,
for it did not look strong enough for the present
strain. He had scarcely got hold of it before it
snapped in the middle, and relieved the strain on
the crocodiles. The steamer backed at the order of
the captain; and a strong line was thrown into the
sampan, which one of the Malays seized and made
fast.</p>

<p>When the strain upon them was thus removed,
the saurians made violent struggles to escape. The
yacht then went ahead again, and the speed-bell was
rung immediately. The pressure on the game was
renewed, and they ceased to struggle. The apparatus
held fast, for the saurian fishers were experienced
in their business, and had done their work
well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>At eight o'clock the Blanchita reached the mouth
of the river. The crocodiles were not dead, but their
stomachs must have been in a terrible condition. To
Louis it seemed to be cruel to prolong their sufferings;
and he wished Achang to request the Malays
to kill them, and Scott agreed with him. The Bornean
said they could not kill them while they were
towing behind, and that, if the lines were slacked,
they might get away.</p>

<p>The captain took the matter in hand, and told
Achang what he intended to do, which he communicated
to the reptile-hunters. On the starboard
hand Scott fixed his gaze on a small tongue of land
extending out into the river. Taking the wheel himself,
he run her close to the land some distance above
the point, and worked the sampan and its tow close
to the shore. The tow-line of the sampan was then
lengthened out to a hundred feet or more, and the
yacht went ahead again, rounding the point, so
that the peninsula lay between the steamer and
her tow.</p>

<p>Then she went ahead again, and the result was
that she pulled the sampan upon the point; and as
she was flat-bottomed, there was no difficulty in doing
so. The Blanchita continued on her course, and
the two crocodiles were landed after her. One of
the Malays then produced a parong latok; and even
more skilfully than Achang had done the job, he cut
off the heads of both reptiles. They were out of
misery then, and Louis was satisfied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The yacht was then run up to the point, and Lane
was sent on shore to measure the reptiles, while the
fishermen proceeded to recover the apparatus from
the stomachs of the defunct reptiles. The larger
crocodile was twelve feet and four inches long, and
the other ten feet and seven inches. The voyage
was resumed on the sea to the mouth of the Sadong;
and in three hours more she entered the stream,
which was a large one, averaging half a mile wide
for twenty miles.</p>

<p>"Bujang!" called Achang, as instructed by the
captain. "Do you want to go any farther?"</p>

<p>The head man replied in his own language that
they wished to go to Simujan, or till they came to
plenty of game. The Bornean said Bujang was a
great hunter, for he had killed fifty-three crocodiles
that year. The yacht, with the sampan still in tow,
started up the river, keeping in the middle of it.
Just before sunset she reached the junction of the
Simujan and Sadong.</p>

<p>On one side of the branch stream there was a considerable
Malay village, backed by an abundance of
cocoanut palms; and, of course, the houses were
built on stilts close to the water. On the other
side was the Chinese kampon, or quarter, consisting
largely of shops and trading-houses. Louis Belgrave
had been presented to the officials at Sarawak as the
owner of the Guardian-Mother, and that established
him as a person of great distinction.</p>

<p>After the ship departed on her voyage to Siam,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
many attentions were bestowed upon him; and when,
after the return of the yacht from up the Sarawak,
they learned that she was going to the Simujan, one
of the officials had given him a letter of introduction
to the Chinese half-cast government official, who was
the magnate of the place. Figuratively, he took the
"Big Four" in his arms, and there was nothing he
was not ready to do for them.</p>

<p>He conducted them to the government house, and
insisted that they should live there during their stay
at Simujan. It had been erected to receive such officials
as might have occasion to remain there at any
time. It was well built and comfortable, and each
chamber had a veranda in front of it. It was set
on posts six feet from the ground, like all the other
dwellings near it. It was the police station of the
region; and the two Malays collected eight or nine
dollars for their game, which they did not offer to
share with the crew of the yacht&mdash;no Malay would
do such a thing.</p>

<p>The agent's tender of the rooms to the party was
accepted, for the members wished to sleep in a four-posted
bedstead once more for a change. The chief
Malay of the place called upon them, and treated
them very handsomely. The Chinese official gave
them much information as they were seated on a
veranda of the house.</p>

<p>"You may find the orang-outang up the Simujan;
but I don't know that you want such large game,"
said he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have shot tigers in India, and Mr. McGavonty
has shot more cobras than all the rest of us.
He has a talent for killing snakes."</p>

<p>"Show me the snakes, and I will finish them,"
added Felix.</p>

<p>"You will not find many of them in the jungle.
There are some water snakes taken occasionally,
and people here eat them. They make a very fine
curry."</p>

<p>"I should ask to be excused from partaking of
that dish," said Scott.</p>

<p>"That is all prejudice," said the agent. "Perhaps
you would like to go a-fishing in the Sadong and its
branches. We have a peculiar way of taking fish
here. We use the tuba plant, which the Malays
prepare for use. It is a climbing-plant, the root
of which has some of the properties of opium. It
is reduced to a pulp, mixed with water. I cannot
fully explain the process of preparation, in which
the Malays are very skilful. At the right time of
tide, the fluid is thrown into the stream. The effect
is to stupefy and sometimes kill the fish. With dip-nets
the fish are picked up, though some of them are
so large that they can be secured only with a kind
of barbed spear."</p>

<p>"I don't think I care to fish in that way," said
Louis, with some disgust in his expression. "It is
very unsportsmanlike, and it looks to me to be a
mean way to do it."</p>

<p>"Just what some Englishmen who were here a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
while ago said, and perhaps you are right; but it is
a Malay art, and not English."</p>

<p>The party slept very comfortably on bedsteads
that night, but they were up before the sun the
next morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>A SPIRITED BATTLE WITH ORANG-OUTANGS</h3>


<p>The civilized people of Simujan were not stirring
when the party came from their chambers. Felipe
had steam up at half-past five, for the captain intended
to begin the ascent of the river; but he did
not care to leave without bidding adieu to the kindly
agent. But they got under way at his order, and
ran up the river for a morning airing. The boat
had not gone more than a mile when the young
men discovered a sampan containing two Malays
paddling with all their might for the shore.</p>

<p>They had no guns, and could not shoot their game,
whatever it was; but each of them had a <i>biliong</i>.
This was the implement Achang had bought in Sarawak.
It looked something like a pickaxe with only
one arm, the end of which was fashioned like a mortising
chisel, and was used as an axe.</p>

<p>The edge of the chisel portion was parallel to the
handle; but Achang explained that the Dyaks had
another kind of biliong, with the cutting part at
right angles with the handle, and this was used as
an adze. While Lane, the carpenter, was ridiculing
the tool, the Malays on shore moved to a tree in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sight of the steamer, which had stopped her screw
close to the sampan.</p>

<p>"They are going to cut down a tree with the biliongs,"
said Achang. "Sometimes do that to get
the game."</p>

<p>"They couldn't cut down a tree a foot through
with those things in a week!" exclaimed Lane.</p>

<p>"So quick as you could cut it down," insisted the
Bornean stoutly.</p>

<p>"Dry up, now, and let us see the Malays work
with the thing," interposed the captain.</p>

<p>"Lane, you shall have a trial with a Dyak or a
Malay, and I will give a prize of three dollars to the
one that fells the tree first," said Louis.</p>

<p>"I should like to try that with any Dyak or Malay,"
replied Lane good-naturedly; and he was a
stout Down-Easter, who had been a logger in the
woods before he was a carpenter or a seaman.</p>

<p>"There are two animals in that tree where they
are at work," cried Morris, as he pointed to the scene
of operations. "One of them is a big one, and the
other is a little one," he added, when he obtained a
better view of the game the Malays were trying to
obtain. "What are they, Achang?"</p>

<p>"Mias! Mias!" exclaimed the native, as a movement
of the boat ahead gave him a full view of the
creatures. "One is a big one, and the other is her
baby."</p>

<p>"But what are the Malays doing now?" asked
Louis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make a stage to stand on," replied Achang.</p>

<p>"What do they want of a stage?" demanded
Lane contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You will see if you wait," added the captain.</p>

<p>They were picking up poles where they could find
them, and cutting saplings, which they dropped with
a single blow of the biliong. In a few minutes they
had constructed a rude framework on crotched sticks,
driven into the soft ground, with a platform of poles
on the top. On this one of the two men mounted
with his biliong, with which he began his work with
a blow at the tree about four feet above the level of
the ground. The other Malay brought from the
sampan a couple of spears, a parong latok, and a
bundle of ropes and rattans.</p>

<p>"Do they use the sumpitan in Borneo now,
Achang?" asked Louis.</p>

<p>"Not Dyaks, Mr. Belgrave; Kyans use it; shoot
poison arrows; sure death; very bad."</p>

<p>The sumpitan is a kind of blow-gun, like the
"bean-blower" formerly used by American boys,
which was a tin pipe, or the "pea-shooter," an English
plaything. It was used, it is said, by the Dyaks
in former times; but recent travellers do not mention
it as used by them. It is about eight feet
long, and less than an inch in diameter, made of
very hard wood, skilfully and accurately bored, and
smoothed inside.</p>

<p>The parong latok, already described, is a heavy
sword. It has a head, sometimes carved as an orna<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>ment,
so that it cannot slip from the hand. At
about one-third of its length from this head, it bends
at an abrupt angle of about thirty-five degrees, and
it makes a very ugly-looking weapon.</p>

<p>"I suppose you all know that a mias is an orang-outang,"
said Louis. "No doubt the weapons carried
up to the tree are to be used in killing the game
when the tree comes down. We could easily bring
down both; but we won't fire at them, for I think
we are all curious to see how the Malays will manage
the affair. The chopper has already made a big cut
in the tree, and I doubt if Lane could have done the
work any quicker."</p>

<p>The carpenter did not say anything, but no doubt
he was greatly surprised at the rapid progress the
native made with the biliong. He had cut the tree
more than half-way through the trunk; and it was
evident that he intended it should fall towards the
river, for the second Malay was clearing away the
ground on that side so that they might have a fair
field for the fight that was to ensue. The chopper
attacked the other side of the tree, and seemed to
deal his blows with even more vigor than before.</p>

<p>The old orang kept up a constant growling. She
had a nest just above the limb where she sat, which
was quite green, indicating that it had been recently
built. It was composed of the branches of the tree
small enough to be easily broken off by the "jungle
man." They were simply placed in a heap on the
limb, with no particular shaping of the resting-place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"She makes a new nest when the branches of the
old one get dry; she like a soft bed," said Achang.
"But the tree will come down now; big fight, they
kill her."</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken these words before the tree
suddenly toppled over, and fell upon the ground with
a heavy crash. The orangs seemed to have no idea
of what was going on at the foot of the tree, and
they were pitched out. The chopper seized one of
the spears, and rushed after the old one. The tree
prevented the party on board the yacht from seeing
the expected battle; and with their rifles in their
hands, the "Big Four" sprang ashore, and secured a
favorable position. The crew followed them, though
the engineer remained at his post.</p>

<p>The first Malay, who had done the chopping, had
confronted the orang, and they stood facing each
other. Suddenly the animal made a spring towards
her enemy, and was received on the point of his
spear. The orang was wounded, but this only increased
her wrath, and she made a furious onslaught
upon the man; but the spear was too much for her,
and she was wounded again.</p>

<p>The orang opened her mouth, and showed a terrible
double row of teeth flanked by four long tusks.
They were enough to intimidate one unaccustomed to
the creature's appearance. She made repeated attempts
to reach her enemy; but the spear, very
adroitly handled, foiled her every time, and gave her
a new wound. This sparring, as it were, was kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
up for some time, and the Americans wondered that
the Malay did not drive his weapon to the heart of
the infuriated animal. Doubtless he would have
done so if he could; but the orang had hands as well
as feet, and she grasped the spear every time it punctured
her skin, and seemed to prevent it from inflicting
a fatal wound.</p>

<p>It was a mystery to the observers how the Malay
contrived to detach his weapon from the grasp of the
orang, though he did so every time. But at last the
brute seemed to change her tactics, or she got a better
hold of the spear; for she suddenly snapped the
weapon into two pieces as though it had been a pipe-stem.
Deprived of his arm, the Malay ran a few
rods. The orang is very clumsy on its feet, and
she could not catch him. The man only went a few
rods to the place where the parong latok had been
placed, and with this weapon he returned to the
attack.</p>

<p>The skirmishing with this weapon continued for
some time longer, and the beast was wounded every
time she attempted to get hold of her opponent. In
the meantime the other Malay had not been idle.
He used no deadly weapons, but substituted for them
a long cord he had brought from the sampan. He
made a slip-noose in one end of it, and was trying to
catch the young one. It might have run away if it
had been so disposed, but it seemed to be determined
to stay by its mother.</p>

<p>"He wants you, or needs your skill with the lasso,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Captain Scott," said Morris, recalling the feats with
the lasso of the commander.</p>

<p>"He is doing very well, and he handles the line
well," replied Scott. "Now he has him!" he exclaimed,
as the Malay passed the cord over the head
of the young orang, and hauled it taut around his
neck.</p>

<p>With the line he dragged the orang to a sapling
near the fallen tree, and, with other lines he had left
there, tied his hands and feet together, and fastened
him to the small tree.</p>

<p>He had hardly secured his victim before a yell
from the first hunter startled him, and he ran with
his lasso and a spear to his assistance. The old one,
badly wounded by the sharp weapon of her enemy,
had suddenly dropped upon all fours, and crawled to
the man; seizing him by his legs, she set her villanous
teeth into the calf of one of them. It looked as
though the human was to be the victim of the brute.</p>

<p>The Malay, howling with the sharp pain, slashed
away with all his might at the hind quarters of the
orang; but she did not relax her grip on his leg. His
companion arrived at the scene of the conflict. He
dropped his lasso then, and began to use his parong
latok. After he saw that blows with the weapon accomplished
nothing, he plunged the blade into the
body of the brute several times in quick succession.
These stabs ended the battle. The orang rolled over,
and then did not move again.</p>

<p>Both of the human combatants then walked down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to the Blanchita, one of them limping badly. They
showed their wounds, and through Achang asked to
be "doctored." Pitts had some skill as a leach, and
the medicine-chest was in his care. He laid out the
patient with the wounded leg, washed the wound, and
then applied some sticking-plaster to the lacerated
member, after he had restored the parts to their natural
position. Then he bandaged the leg quite skilfully,
so as to keep all the parts in place. The hands
of the other were covered with sticking-plaster and
bandaged.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the seamen, the carcass of
the old orang was dragged down to the river, and put
in the sampan of the Malays. The young one was as
ugly as sin itself, and tried to get at the men to bite
them. Finally Clingman stuffed a piece of rope into
his mouth, and tied it around his head so tight that
he could not shut his mouth. He was mad, but he
could not bite. He was put into the sampan, and
made fast there.</p>

<p>The yacht got under way again, and with the
Malay sampan in tow, headed down the river. The
tide was running out at a mill-stream pace, for the
water in the stream had risen far beyond its usual
level. Achang shook his head as he looked at the
rapid outward flow of the water; but the steamer
went at railroad speed, and the boys enjoyed it
hugely.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Achang?" asked the captain,
as he observed the uneasy movements of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Bornean as the yacht approached the junction with
the Sadong.</p>

<p>"Have bore soon; better go no farther," replied
the native. "Upset all boats and sampans."</p>

<p>Captain Scott ordered the helmsman to go to the
shore, and there the painter of the Malay sampan was
cast off, and her men got to the land.</p>

<p>"There it goes up the Sadong!" cried Achang, as
he pointed to the broad stream.</p>

<p>A wave, estimated to be about ten feet high, fringing,
curling, and lashed into foam, and roaring in its
wrath, rolled up the river. It struck two small sampans,
upset them, and spilled the men in them into
the angry, boiling waters. With less fury it rolled
up the Simujan, and Scott rushed to the wheel himself.
He "faced the music," and headed the yacht
into the wave. She rose some feet in the air at the
bow, and passed over it. She was too far from the
banks to be thrown ashore, and no harm was done.</p>

<p>These bores are not uncommon on the Sadong; and
they were not a new thing to those on board of the
Blanchita, for they had seen one in the Hoogly at
Calcutta; but even Scott, who was a bold navigator,
would not have cared to be in the river when a wave
ten feet high swept on his craft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>A PERFORMANCE OF VERY AGILE GIBBONS</h3>


<p>The cabin party went on shore and breakfasted
with their Chinese friend, who had invited them to
the meal the evening before. It was a very pleasant
occasion, and it occupied half the forenoon. The
host gave them useful information, and listened with
interest to their account of the battle with the orang-outangs.
When they left the house they found the
two Malays who had been their companions in the
morning waiting for them.</p>

<p>One of them presented a tarsier to Scott. It was
a very pretty and curious little creature, belonging
to the monkey tribe. It had very large eyes, and
was certainly very cunning. It appeared to be playful,
but his new owner got a nip from its teeth
which warned him to be careful. The most curious
part of the animal was its legs, the hind ones being
much the longer.</p>

<p>Its five slender toes ended in what looked like
balls, which proved to be flat, and acted like the foot
of a fly, retaining by suction its hold upon the tree
where it lived. The spine of its neck was so constructed
that it could describe a circle with its head.
Its long hind legs enabled it to leap like a kangaroo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The other Malay brought with him a flying dragon,
a king of lizards, said to be the reptile from which
the fables of the original dragons originated. It has
a pair of membranes with the semblance of wings,
with which it sustains itself in the air in its leaps
from one tree or branch to another, as the flying-fish
does in its flights over the water.</p>

<p>The party took leave with many thanks of the
Chinese agent, and promised to visit him on their
return from up the river. Louis stated that they
wanted to kill one full-sized orang-outang, for the
one killed by the Malays was so cut up and chopped
in the fight that she was not in condition to be
stuffed and kept as a good specimen.</p>

<p>"You will find them on the Simujan, but hardly
anywhere else in the island except in this vicinity,
on the Sadong, Batang Lupar, and their branches,"
replied the agent. "The orangs have been hunted
so much, especially by naturalists, that they are becoming
scarce; and they are likely to become extinct,
for the scientists are looking for the 'missing link,'
as they call it."</p>

<p>The speaker laughed as he made the last remark;
and it was evident that he was not a Darwinian, or
at least that he had not followed out the theory of
evolution. Taking their places in the yacht, the
captain gave the order to cast off the fasts, the
boat stood up the river, and soon passed the scene
of the morning's conflict.</p>

<p>"Gibbons!" exclaimed Achang, pointing to a por<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>tion
of the forest where the trees were sparsely
scattered.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen of them, and they seemed
to be engaged in a frolic. This ape has been described
in a former volume, for it is abundant in
Sumatra. Louis wished to observe the movements
of the animal, which has very long arms, is wonderfully
agile, and a gymnast of the first order. It
could travel all over Borneo where forests exist without
touching the ground, passing from tree to tree
in long leaps. The boat was stopped in the river, in
order to permit the party to witness the exhibition
which was in process, without the payment of any
admission fee.</p>

<p>Every branch was a trapeze, and no troupe of artists
could compare with them in the agility of their
movements. Their long arms appeared to be the key
to their marvellous feats, for their legs were comparatively
short, and for the size of their bodies the
animals possessed immense strength.</p>

<p>"If some enterprising manager of a theatre devoting
himself to athletic exhibitions could secure
the services of the half dozen gibbons which are
giving us a free show, he would make his fortune
in our country," said Louis. "Don't try to see them
all at once, but watch that fellow on the right."</p>

<p>The one indicated grasped a horizontal branch
with his hands, his arms looking like the ropes of
a swing. He was swaying to and fro with great
rapidity, apparently trying to see how fast he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
go, for he put a tremendous amount of vigor into
his efforts. In an exhibition hall he would have
"brought down the house," and would certainly
have received an "<i>encore</i>."</p>

<p>Suddenly, while he was swinging at a dizzy speed,
he let go his hold upon the branch, and seemed to
be flying through the air; but with his fingered feet
he seized another branch, not less than forty feet
from the first, and, with his long arms extended to
the utmost, continued to swing in this inverted position.
The observers were so delighted with this
skilful performance that they applauded lustily by
clapping their hands. The noise did not disturb the
performers, and the actor that had so distinguished
himself appeared to put even greater vigor into his
movements.</p>

<p>Possibly he was getting up a momentum; for he
soon released the hold of his feet on the branch,
went flying through the air with his long arms extended
ahead of him in the direction of another
favorable limb of a tree, and grasped it with his
hands. After swinging for a moment, he drew himself
up on the branch, and proceeded to walk up to
a greater height, using his hands to assist in keeping
his equilibrium. This was a fair specimen of the
performance of every member of the troupe.</p>

<p>One of the company appeared to see something on
the ground that attracted his attention; and he made
a flying leap to a lower branch, and then dropped
himself upon the soil. Looking about him for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
moment, he apparently discovered a bush with some
sort of fruit on it, for he immediately began to walk
towards it. As a walkist he was far from being a
success, and his awkward movements excited the
laughter of the interested spectators. In his present
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> he would have made an excellent clown in a circus
ring.</p>

<p>His short legs seemed to be incapable of fully
supporting his body, and he behaved like an inexperienced
athlete walking on a tight rope without
a balancing-pole. His long arms served as this implement,
and with a bend at the elbows and the
hands dropped down, he waddled along very slowly.</p>

<p>"It's heavy sea for that fellow, and he looks like
a landlubber trying to walk the deck in a rough sea,"
said Captain Scott. "But I fancy the performance
is over, and it is time to shoot some of the actors if
that is what you intend to do."</p>

<p>"For one, I don't intend to do anything of the
sort," replied Louis, with considerable energy in his
tones. "I don't believe in killing for the sake of
killing, or for the fun of it. My admiration of the
skilful performance we have just witnessed will not
allow me to kill the actors or any of them."</p>

<p>"What did we come to Borneo for, Louis?" asked
the captain.</p>

<p>"To see the country, and explore some of its rivers."</p>

<p>"I thought we came here to hunt and fish," added
Scott.</p>

<p>"I did not come here to kill harmless creatures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for the fun of it. We want a full-grown orang, and
I am ready to hunt for him," replied Louis. "We
want him for the purpose of study, and to show to
our friends on board of the ship. I don't object to
shooting any bird or animal to extend our information."</p>

<p>Louis had his double-barrelled fowling-piece in his
hand. Suddenly he brought it to his shoulder and
fired. All eyes were directed to the shore, and a
large bird was seen to drop upon the ground. The
captain started the boat, and ran her up to the bank.
Clinch leaped ashore, and soon brought the bird on
board. Its plumage was highly colored and very
beautiful.</p>

<p>"What do you call that bird, Louis?" asked
Morris.</p>

<p>"Chambers calls it simply the argus, but the
more common name is the argus-pheasant," replied
Louis.</p>

<p>"Faix, he's a magnificent crayter; and what a long
tail our cat has got," added Felix, as he spread the
bird out on the gunwale.</p>

<p>The last remark referred to the long tail of the
bird, which made the entire length from the bill to
the end of it about five feet. Only two of the
feathers were thus prolonged, adding about three
feet to the dimension. The variety of colors were
jet black, deep brown, fawn, white, and a number of
secondary hues. The bird, deprived of his feathers,
is about the size of an ordinary hen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you can't see him at his best now that he is
dead," continued Louis, who had read up the animal
life he expected to find in Borneo. "Like a peacock,
though to a less extent, he can spread out his pretty
feathers, but not in the same manner; for they open
out in the form of a circle, making a sort of round
disk on his back and concealing his head. If you
could see the bird alive with his wings spread out
you would find every feather had a number of marks
that look like eyes, and seventeen have been counted
on one of them. Each of these marks consists in
part of a jet-black ring, with other different colored
rings inside of it, which make the whole figure like
an eye.</p>

<p>"You remember a fellow who was called Argus in
mythology, who had a hundred eyes, of which only
two were ever asleep at the same time. This bird
gets his name from him; though the story is that
Mercury killed him, and Venus transferred his eyes
to the tail of the peacock."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the lecture, Louis," said Scott when
he had finished his description. "It was certainly a
part of our plan in coming to Borneo to study natural
history; and we are doing so instead of shooting all
the time."</p>

<p>Just at this moment Felix, who had wandered
from the fore cabin to the waist, discharged his fowling-piece.
The Milesian was as good a shot as Louis,
for both of them had been trained in the same shooting-gallery
in New York. All hands rushed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rail to ascertain what the hunter had brought down.
On the bank of the river they discovered a creature
about two feet long, lying on its back, and struggling
in its death-throes.</p>

<p>Lane leaped ashore, and soon laid the animal on
the gunwale of the boat by the side of the argus. It
was a queer-looking creature about the head, and no
one on board except Achang had ever seen one like
it. For the length of the head, the muzzle was very
broad, hardly less than three inches. It was covered
with a soft and rather long fur on its body, dark
brown in color.</p>

<p>"What do you call my game, Mr. Naturalist?"
demanded Felix, addressing Louis, who was looking
the animal over.</p>

<p>"<i>Cynogale Bennetti</i>," replied the young naturalist
very gravely.</p>

<p>"Faix, that's jist what I thought he was whin Oi
foired at him," added Felix. "Sin O, gal! But
what had Ben Netty to do wid it? Or was Netty
the name of the gal?"</p>

<p>"I gave you the scientific name because this creature
has no plain English name, though the natives
here call it the <i>mampalon</i>," added Louis.</p>

<p>"That's what we call it; but I forgot the name,"
said Achang.</p>

<p>"He is one of the otter family; and Mr. Hornaday,
whose book I hope you will all read when you return
to the ship, thought it might be called the otter-cat.
I wish we could have taken him alive, for it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
have made a very nice specimen to set up in the
cabin of the Guardian-Mother."</p>

<p>"I should like to knock over the big orang-outang
you want, Louis, my darling," continued Felix.
"There comes a covered sampan up the river," he
added, pointing down the stream.</p>

<p>Many such covered boats are used on the rivers.
On a frame of bamboo or other wood was a covering
of leaves, each of which is six to seven feet long, and
two inches wide. They are sewed together with a
thread of rattan, overlaying each other, like tiles or
shingles, thus shedding the rain. They were in strips
or squares, so that they could be readily removed.
The sides were sometimes curtained with the same
material. The long leaves are taken from the nipa
palm, which grows abundantly in the island, and
serves a great many useful purposes.</p>

<p>The boat waited to see the covered sampan, and
later there appeared to be two of them. As they
approached, the familiar voice of the Chinese agent
was heard hailing the party. It appeared that this
gentleman was bound up the river to a Dyak village,
a few miles farther up.</p>

<p>"You had better go with us," said the agent, as
his sampan stopped abreast of the steamer. "I
spoke to you about a Dyak long-house; and you will
have an opportunity to examine one, and to sleep in
it if you are disposed to do so. You will be received
very kindly, and have a chance to see the people as
well as the houses."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Eng Quee; we will certainly go
with you," replied Captain Scott, prompted by Louis.
"We will heave you a line, and tow you up."</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the steamer moved up the
river with the two sampans in tow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A VISIT TO A DYAK LONG-HOUSE</h3>


<p>As the Blanchita approached her destination many
Dyaks appeared on the shores. They were Sea Dyaks
in this region; and the name seems to have come
down from a former era in the history of the island,
for at the present time they have little or no connection
with a sea-faring life, and their sampans are
mainly if not entirely used on the rivers. But formerly
they built large war-boats, or <i>bankongs</i>, some
of which were seventy feet long.</p>

<p>These craft did not go to sea. The naval battles
were fought on rivers and lakes; for the boats were
not adapted to heavy weather, and could not have
lived even in a moderate gale. They were propelled
entirely by oars, single banked, and twenty-four
rowers were all that could work. The largest of
them had a platform or elevated deck, under which
the oarsmen sat, and on which the warriors engaged
the enemy.</p>

<p>Some sort of strategy was used; for the small boats
were sent ahead sometimes to skirmish with the foe,
and lure their canoes to a point where the larger
craft were concealed, which then came out and fell
upon the enemy. If the craft were used for purposes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of piracy, as they were in the northern part of the
island, in attacking foreign vessels, it could only be
when the strangers were caught within a short distance
of the shores.</p>

<p>Mr. Eng came on board of the yacht when his sampans
were taken in tow, and was seated with the
cabin party on the forward seats. He spoke English
perfectly, and explained everything that needed it as
the boat proceeded. The explorers had seen Dyaks
enough, but had not before taken the trouble to study
them; for they seemed not to be in touch with the
civilization of Sarawak, and were "hewers of wood
and drawers of water," and not proper specimens of
the race.</p>

<p>"The men here, Mr. Eng, do not appear to be very
powerful physically," said Louis, as they passed several
laborers at work in a paddy.</p>

<p>"They are not as strong as Englishmen and Americans,"
replied the agent, glancing at the seamen in
the waist. "The tallest man I have seen among the
Sea Dyaks was not more than five and a half feet in
height. Five feet three inches is a more common
figure, though the average is less than that. They
are not men of great strength; but they are active, of
great endurance, and in running they exhibit great
speed."</p>

<p>"These people are not ruined by their tailors'
bills," said Scott.</p>

<p>"They do not need much clothing in this climate;
and a piece of bark-cloth a yard wide is full dress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
here. The <i>chawat</i>, as they call this garment, is about
five feet long, and is wound around the waist tightly,
and drawn between the legs, one end hanging down
in front, and the other behind. They wear a sort of
turban on the head; and some of them have as many
as four rings, large and small, hanging from their
ears, through which they pass. Some of them use
white cotton instead of bark-cloth, like the Hindoos
in India."</p>

<p>The yacht was now approaching the landing-place
pointed out by the agent. A crowd of women and
children were hurrying to the riverside. They appeared
to be lighter in complexion than the men. As
a rule they were not handsome, though a few of them
were rather pretty. The American visitors were not
likely to fall in love with any of the young women
on the shore. They were all in "full dress," which
means simply a petticoat, reaching from the waist to
the knees, made of bark-cloth embroidered with various
figures.</p>

<p>A few of the females wore a sort of red jacket and
the conical Malay hat; but those are used only on
"state occasions." The single garment was secured
at the waist by being drawn into a belt of rattans, colored
black. Above this was worn a coil of many
rings of large brass wire; and all of them seemed to
be provided with this appendage. There was some
variety in the use of this ornament; for some wore it
tightly wound around the body, while others had it
quite loose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to this some of the young girls had a
dozen rings of various sizes hanging loosely around
their necks, and falling upon the chest, which had no
other covering. Their eyes were black, as was also
their hair, which was very luxuriant, and generally
well cared for, being tied up in a cue behind.</p>

<p>The village did not consist of a great number of
small buildings, but from the landing-place could be
seen the end of an immense structure with a forest
of palms behind it. The rear of it was not perpendicular,
but slanted outward, like many of the walls
of corn-houses in New England, doubtless to keep the
rain from the roof from penetrating. All the party,
including the sailors, landed; for Mr. Eng declared
that the Dyaks were honest, and even in Sarawak
were never known to steal anything, though the
Malays and Chinamen were given to pilfering.</p>

<p>The crowd of men, women, and children gathered
on the shore had looked the Blanchita over with the
closest attention while the Americans were looking
them over. The party landed under the escort of
the agent, and took up the line of march for the big
house. The entire crowd of Dyaks followed them,
though they did not intrude upon them; on the contrary,
they treated all of the visitors with a respect
and deference bordering on homage.</p>

<p>"That 'long-house,' as we call it here, is nearly
two hundred feet in length," said Mr. Eng. "It is
thirty feet wide. Now you can see more of it; and
you notice that it is set upon a multitude of posts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
like all Malay and Dyak houses. These posts are
firmly set in the ground; and being about six inches
in diameter, you can readily see that the house rests
on a solid foundation. It is not likely to be blown
down in any ordinary gale, though a hurricane might
sweep it away. Not a nail, not a wooden pin or peg,
is used in the construction of such buildings."</p>

<p>"Then, I should think any ordinary gale would
level them to the ground," suggested Louis.</p>

<p>"But the Dyaks have a substitute for nails or
pins," replied the guide. "All the poles and sticks
and boards are tightly bound together with rattans;
and I believe they hold together better than if they
were nailed."</p>

<p>"I observed in England and France that the stagings
used in the erection of buildings were made
partly of round poles, tied together with ropes. I
talked with a man who told me they were stronger
than if put together with nails," said Morris.</p>

<p>"I think he was right. I can't tell you how the
Malays and Dyaks manage the rattan to render it so
flexible, but it seems to me they make better work
than ropes. On the back of this house, there is not a
single window or other opening," continued Mr. Eng,
as the party stood at the end of the structure, near
the rear corner. "The disagreeable feature of the
building, or rather of the habits of the occupants, is
that the space under it, ten feet between the ground
and the floor, is a catch-all for all refuse matter, and
you notice that an unpleasant odor comes from it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is this the only entrance to it?" asked Scott,
pointing to a door, which was reached by a log notched
like a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>"There is a door at the other end also; and there
may be ways of mounting the platform, or veranda,
which forms the front of the building, as climbing a
post, or dropping from a tree. Some of the posts, of
which you see a multitude under the house, are cut
off at the first floor, while many of them reach up to
the roof, and support it. We will go in now, if you
like; and, being sailors, I suppose you can climb the
log."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that," replied Scott, who was the first
to ascend. "Are all that crowd coming up?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; they are the occupants of the long-house,
and they must be at home in order to do the
honors of the occasion," laughed the guide.</p>

<p>The villagers followed the party, and immediately
manifested their politeness in various ways. The
prettiest girl in the crowd spoke to Louis; though he
did not understand a word she said, but replied to her
in English, when she was as much at sea as he had
been.</p>

<p>"What does she say, Achang?" he asked of the
Bornean.</p>

<p>"<i>Tabet, tuan</i>," replied the native.</p>

<p>"I heard her say that; but what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means, 'Good-day, sir,'" answered the Bornean;
and he proceeded to tell her that Louis was the "head
man," very rich, and owned a big ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>She made a very graceful obeisance to him, and
then rushed away through a door on the side of the
grand hall, as it may well be called. But she returned
immediately, bringing a very elaborately worked mat,
which she spread on the floor at the feet of the "head
man." Then she spread out her hands, and bowed
low, saying something which was Greek to him.</p>

<p>"She invites you to take a seat on the mat,"
Achang explained.</p>

<p>As a matter of politeness Louis seated himself, and
looked at the maiden who treated him with so much
consideration. By this time the other women were
bringing mats for the rest of the party, making no
distinction between the seamen and the cabin party.
The latter followed the example of the young millionaire,
and seated themselves. The foremast hands declined
the proffered courtesy; and Achang explained
to the ladies that only the four young men who were
seated were the magnates of the company, while the
others were inferior personages, for the Bornean was
not strictly democratic in his ideas.</p>

<p>"We will look at the house now, if you please,"
said Mr. Eng, after the "Big Four" had been seated a
few minutes; and all of them rose to their feet, bowing
low to the young ladies who had treated them
with so much distinction.</p>

<p>About forty or fifty of the posts extended from
the ground, for the visitors had not time to count
them; and most of them had suspended upon them
various trophies of the hunt, including the antlers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of deer, crocodiles' heads, weapons, paddles, and
spears. In the middle of the long hall a fire was
burning on a foundation of soil, enclosed by a border
of wood. In the roof was a sort of scuttle, which
was fastened open to admit the air, and to allow
some of the smoke to escape, though there was
plenty of it remaining in the apartment.</p>

<p>"What is that overhead, Mr. Eng?" asked Louis,
pointing to a black mass suspended near the fire,
though he had a suspicion of its nature.</p>

<p>"That is a collection of human skulls, relics of the
days of head-hunting; for they are generally kept
in a building erected for the purpose, though appropriated
at the present time partly to other uses.
There are about twenty of them, which is not a large
number for a village like this. Not one of them is
less than twenty years old; for Rajah Brooke put an
end to head-hunting long ago, though some of it has
been done in spite of his edicts. A lady beckons
to you, Mr. Belgrave."</p>

<p>The pretty girl&mdash;by comparison&mdash;stood by his
side, pointing to one of the numerous doors at the
closed side of the house. Louis followed her, and
she conducted him into a room. A portion of the
floor was covered with mats on which the occupants
sleep, with an earth section for a fire. There
was no furniture of any kind. The roof of the
building was covered with square pieces of palm
like those used on the sampans, and these could be
raised in each room when necessary for air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"This apartment is occupied by one family, or by
a married couple, and unmarried men and boys sleep
in the attic overhead," said Mr. Eng. "It has but
one door, the one opening into the main hall. This
is a house of sixteen doors; and by this enumeration
the size of the village is stated, and this number
gauges the taxes to be paid."</p>

<p>"Citizens cannot dodge their taxes here, then, as
some of them do in the United States," said Scott.</p>

<p>The party walked the entire length of the hall,
and then passed out upon the platform, which was
not covered, and was used for various purposes, such
as drying rice or other articles. The floors were
composed of strips of palm, not more than an inch
and a half wide, and placed an inch apart. They
were lashed to the floor joists, or poles, with rattan.</p>

<p>"Those doors, which indicate the taxable rate of
the village, look as though they were cut out of
single planks," said Scott.</p>

<p>"And so they are," replied the agent.</p>

<p>"I have seen no saw-mills here, and I suppose
they bring the lumber from England or India."</p>

<p>"Not at all, though some may be obtained in that
manner. They are made from the buttress of the
tapang-tree, which you must have seen."</p>

<p>"I have not noticed any such thing, though perhaps
none of us could identify it," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"It is found growing out in triangular form from
just above the roots of the tree. In a large one it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
twelve or fifteen feet long. It makes a natural plank
two inches thick, which may be trimmed into any
shape with the biliong."</p>

<p>The party were ready to depart; and they made all
sorts of courteous gestures to their hosts, especially
the ladies. The women asked them for tobacco, as
Achang interpreted the requests. They had none,
but some of the seamen supplied them with all they
had about them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE DYAKS.</h3>


<p>After seeing the sleeping accommodations of the
Dyaks, consisting of a mat on a rather uneven floor,
the Americans concluded to pass the night on board
of the yacht. They invited Mr. Eng to supper on
board, and he passed the evening with them in the
cabin.</p>

<p>"You have seen the Dyaks at home now, young
gentlemen; how do you like the looks of them?"
asked the guest, after the meal had been disposed of.</p>

<p>"I think they are the pleasantest savages I have
ever met," replied Louis.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you did not appreciate the young
women who were so attentive to you, Mr. Belgrave,"
continued the agent.</p>

<p>"Regarding them as uncivilized maidens, they are
about the best specimens. The expression on their
faces was pleasant, a few of them were pretty,
though as a whole they were not handsome, and they
seemed to be kind-hearted. I could not admire them,
though their eyes were as brilliant as they were
black. Their long hair would be the envy of many
an English or American belle."</p>

<p>"The women are very vain of their hair. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
bestow a great deal of attention upon it," added Mr.
Eng. "The fever of the island sometimes deprives
them of their hair, as it may in your country, and
that is the greatest calamity that can overtake the
younger women."</p>

<p>"I suppose it all right here; but they disfigure and
spoil one of the principal attractions of ladies in enlightened
nations, the teeth, which they blacken by
chewing betel."</p>

<p>"It also makes their lips look as though they had
daubed them with blood or red paint; but they do it
here, as in India, to make themselves more beautiful.
Tastes differ, and the practice makes them ugly
to you. The betel-vine grows here, and the leaves
are used for chewing. The nut of a certain palm
produces the same effect on the teeth."</p>

<p>"I don't admire the brass rings they wear on
their waists and around their necks. If I were old
enough to get married, I should not look for a wife
among the Dyak girls," said Louis, laughing and
shaking his head.</p>

<p>"The Dyak women are generally well treated; but
they have to work very hard, and much that you
would think the men ought to do is done by them.
The lords of creation here are inclined to be lazy,
while their wives and daughters are engaged in the
rice-fields, though their husbands and brothers are
driven to labor.</p>

<p>"But the women are not the abject slaves you
sometimes find them in the savage state. They have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
their influence, and exercise a degree of control in
household matters. The females are fond of fish,
and insist that their husbands shall supply them with
this diet. On account of the bores which sweep up
the rivers, this is often a dangerous occupation, and
the men are unable to procure any fish. Instances
are known in which the women bar the door of the
house against them if they are unsuccessful."</p>

<p>"I believe the Malays are generally Mohammedans.
What is the religion of the Dyaks?" inquired Louis.</p>

<p>"It has been said by some travellers that they
have no religion of any kind; but I don't think this
is quite true, though it is not far from it," replied
Mr. Eng. "Religion is a very indefinite idea among
the Dyaks, and they are chary in speaking of what
there is of it. Some who have been among them
maintain that they believe in a Supreme Being, who
has a great many different names among the various
tribes. They have almost as many inferior deities
as the Hindus.</p>

<p>"They are very superstitious; and there are all
sorts of omens, among which there is a particular
bird which has obtained the name of the omen bird.
His cry on the right of, or behind, a person engaged
in any enterprise is an unlucky sign, and he abandons
his object; while the cry heard on the left is
a favorable omen, and the individual is duly encouraged
to go forward.</p>

<p>"I had a story from a Kyan head man which had
come down to him as a tradition. A great head-hunting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
expedition, consisting of a thousand warriors,
had set out many years ago. It had not gone far
when a little muntjac, which you know is a kind of
deer, ran across the path of the warriors. This was
a bad omen; and they gave up the enterprise, and
returned to their villages.</p>

<p>"I know of a couple just married who separated
because they heard a deer-cry within three days after
their union, which was a sign that one of them would
die within a year. Even little insects intimidate
doughty warriors, or assure them that they are far
from danger, by their appearance or their cry."</p>

<p>"There is not a little of similar superstition in
enlightened nations, though there is vastly less of it
than formerly," added Louis.</p>

<p>"I have heard my grandfather say that the ticking
of a death-watch used to scare him so that he could
not sleep when he was a boy," said Morris.</p>

<p>"What is a death-watch?" asked Scott.</p>

<p>"It is a kind of beetle that conceals itself in the
walls of old houses," replied Louis. "The noise it
makes is really the call of the bug for his mate, and
is the cry of love instead of death, as many ignorant
people believe. The breaking of a looking-glass is
also a sign of death in the family."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blossom wouldn't break a looking-glass for
a fortune," added Felix. "She says she broke one
nine years before her husband died, and therefore it
was a sure sign."</p>

<p>"But the death must come within a year to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the sign hold good," replied Louis. "But if enlightened
people have faith in such stuff, it is no
wonder that Dyaks believe in omens. I want to ask,
Mr. Eng, if these Dyaks are regularly married?"</p>

<p>"They are, though with very little ceremony, and
no vows, oaths, nor promises. In fact, the marriage
consists of such rites as the parties please, and often
with no rites at all. Sometimes the betrothed are
married by exchanging bracelets in public, or by eating
a meal of rice together. In some communities
the affianced are seated on a couple of bars of iron,
and the head man shakes a couple of live chickens
over their heads, invoking many blessings upon them,
and the birds are afterwards killed and eaten."</p>

<p>"Do these people drink liquor, or have they anything
in the shape of intoxicating fluids?" asked
Scott.</p>

<p>"The national drink of Borneo is <i>tuak</i>, about the
vilest tipple that ever was invented. I went to a
Dyak feast when I first came to the island, which
proved to be nothing but a series of drunken orgies.
The principal actors at the feast were a number of
pretty girls, such as you saw this afternoon. Their
office was to induce the men present to drink this vile
liquid till they dropped on the floor of the open platform;
and they even poured it down the throats of
their victims when no longer able to drink for themselves."</p>

<p>"What sort of rum is it?" inquired Scott.</p>

<p>"It looks like the milk of the cocoanut, and I sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>pose
that it is made from that; but I did not taste
it," replied the agent. "It is about my bedtime,
and I think I will go to my sampan and retire."</p>

<p>But Captain Scott invited him to sleep on board
of the Blanchita; and he accepted after a little pressing,
evidently believing that the soft cushions of the
yacht made a better bed than the mats of the sampan.
Felipe was instructed to have steam on at daylight,
and the anchor watch was to call him in season
to do so. Fully protected by their nettings from the
mosquitoes, which had troubled them to some extent
in the evening, all hands slept like tired boys.</p>

<p>When the steam from the gauge-cocks hissed as
the engineer examined into the condition of the
water in the boiler, the sound waked the captain,
and he jumped from his bed. This movement roused
all the others; and they went out into the waist,
following the example of Scott, who wore nothing
but his nightdress.</p>

<p>"I am going to have a swim this fine morning,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Look out for crocodiles," Morris interposed.
"You know they are man-eaters in these rivers."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen any of them around here," replied
the captain. "But call all hands, Lane; and tell
the men to bring out their rifles."</p>

<p>"I think you are very imprudent to go into the
water here," interposed Mr. Eng. "The reptiles
are on the watch; and if you must go in, I warn
you to keep near the boat."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>But the boys all dived from the gunwale into
the river, and swam out a few rods. The men
placed themselves on the rail, and kept a sharp
look out for saurians, though it was still too dark
to enable them to see very distinctly. Scott had
reasoned that he could not take his bath after it
was fully light, for a crowd of Dyak men and women
would be on the bank at that time.</p>

<p>The swimmers had not been in the water more
than five minutes when the cry of "Crocodiles!"
came from Achang, who had stationed himself just
forward of the engine. Probably he had a keener
vision for the reptiles than the Americans; for the
seamen had not yet seen anything that looked like
one. He could tell by the appearance of the water
that the enemy was approaching, though the disturbance
of its surface was near the other side of
the stream.</p>

<p>The party in the water turned about, and headed
for the boat, swimming with all the vigor they could
command. Achang had his rifle in his hand; but
even he could not make out the crocodile clearly
enough to be sure of his aim. Five minutes more
elapsed; for it required that time for the swimmers
to reach the yacht. The seamen assisted the party
into the boat, and they rushed with all speed into
the cabin; for a quartet of Dyak maidens had already
reached the bank of the river, and were begging the
men for more tobacco.</p>

<p>Achang fired his rifle; but three crocodiles could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
now be seen moving towards the yacht. Their approach
was not impeded by the shot, for it was
impossible to see the eyes of the reptiles in the
semi-darkness. But the cabin party were safe, and
it was as useless to fire at them as it would have
been at a stone wall.</p>

<p>"I advise you not to try that experiment again,
young gentlemen," said Mr. Eng as the bathing
party came out into the waist.</p>

<p>"I don't think we shall, though we were protected
by half a dozen rifles," replied the captain, who had
been the leader in the venturesome exploit.</p>

<p>"If you do try it again, do so in the daylight,
when your riflemen can see the eyes of the enemy,"
added the agent. "I must bid you good-by now, for
I have business on shore here. I don't think the
crocodiles will come any nearer to you, but be prudent.
I shall hope to see you at Simujan on your
return."</p>

<p>Mr. Eng shook hands with all the cabin party, and
went ashore. The captain gave the order to cast off
the fasts, and Lane was ordered to take the wheel.
The two sampans had before made fast to the shore;
and as the Blanchita got under way, one of them put
off, and paddled towards the crocodiles. The last
that was seen of the craft, it had a saurian hooked
after the Malay mode of fishing for them.</p>

<p>After breakfast had been served in the cabin, and
the party had gone to their seats forward, the character
of the river began to change, becoming much nar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>rower.
They came to another Dyak village, where
the jungle was cleared off and paddies were near the
stream. It looked as though all the inhabitants had
gathered on the bank, male and female. A long-house
was to be seen on a knoll, and the wheelman
was ordered to take the boat within a couple of rods
of the shore.</p>

<p>"Are you going to make a landing at this village,
Captain Scott?" asked Louis.</p>

<p>"No; we have seen enough of these people, but
we will see what we can as we pass along. They are
all beckoning us to go ashore; but we won't do so,
for any more Dyak maidens would be rather monotonous."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Captain, though there is
one with a big stick of bamboo in her hand, who
looks more graceful and pretty than any we saw in
the village we visited," replied Louis.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that cane is for," added Scott.</p>

<p>"That's to contain some kind of liquid; and she
may have four feet of tuak in it," answered the millionaire,
laughing at the idea of measuring a fluid by
Long Measure. "I think the girl comes nearer to
being a beauty than any girl I have seen before."</p>

<p>"She is hooped with brass like all the rest of
them," added Scott, as the boat proceeded beyond
the group on the shore.</p>

<p>In another half-hour great trees, with an abundant
undergrowth of bushes, extended down to the river,
and in places some distance into the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>STEAMBOATING THROUGH A GREAT FOREST</h3>


<p>Although there was a wall of green on each side
of the boat, and the river was not more than sixty
feet wide, the explorers found that everything close to
the earth was under water. If the dense jungle had
not prevented, they might have sailed inland, they
knew not how many miles. As the stream became
narrower the current increased in force. The trees
were full of monkeys, and hundreds of them appeared
to be in sight all the time. They were of the most
common kind to be found in Borneo, and the yacht
created no excitement among them. They were so
tame that any number of them could have been
brought down by the hunters.</p>

<p>"The water is not so dirty as it has been everywhere
below," said Captain Scott, as the Blanchita
stemmed the current without any difficulty, where
paddling a sampan must have been a laborious occupation.
"It is tolerably clear along here, and we
might take our morning bath very comfortably."</p>

<p>"We might if a big crocodile did not break his way
through the bushes to pay us a visit," replied Louis.</p>

<p>"After the experience of this morning, I am not
disposed to try it again, and I shall take my bath in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
wash-bowl with a sponge, though I am very fond of
swimming. But, Louis, don't you think we have had
about enough of hunting in Borneo?"</p>

<p>"Enough! Why, we have not yet been a week on
the island," replied Louis, not a little astonished at
the captain's question. "I have enjoyed myself very
well so far, and I certainly do not wish to leave till
we have killed at least one good-sized orang."</p>

<p>"It is rather stupid hunting here, for about all
the country is under water," added Scott. "There
seems to be nothing but monkeys here; and they are
very small game, even if we were disposed to shoot
them."</p>

<p>"But there are some lakes up the river, Mr. Eng
told me; and I think we shall get out of this tangle
very soon; and when we come to higher ground we
will go on shore, and try our luck on foot."</p>

<p>The captain talked as though he had some scheme
in his head which he was not yet prepared to unfold
to his companions. But what could he do? Nothing
had been said on board of the ship about coming back
to Sarawak for the hunters, and to give up hunting
and exploring would be simply to return to Kuching,
and idle away the time for the next two weeks.
Louis did not like this idea at all; and yet it seemed
to be the alternative which Scott must have in his
mind.</p>

<p>"Mias!" shouted Achang, when the conversation
had proceeded so far.</p>

<p>"Where is your mias?" demanded Louis; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
most of the party had come to calling the orang by
his Malay name.</p>

<p>The Bornean pointed into the forest, the trees of
which were growing in the water, though there was
an undergrowth of screw-pines, which had been abundant
all along the river. They were not pines as the
explorers understood the word at home. The plant
is a bush or small tree with half a dozen or more
branches angling upward from the trunk, and twisting
a little towards it, from which feature it takes its
name. It has long, lanceolated leaves, and therefore
is not at all like the American pine.</p>

<p>"Stop her, Lane!" called the captain in a tone
that "meant business." "Back her!"</p>

<p>The last order was given because there was an
opening through the screw-pines which afforded a
full view of the taller trees about twenty rods farther
from the stream. The captain then took the wheel
from Lane, rang the gong to go ahead; and, putting
the helm hard-a-starboard, the boat came about,
headed into the opening. Looking forward, there
seemed but very few trees or bushes compared with
the number along the flowing stream.</p>

<p>"Do you see the mias, Louis?" asked Scott.</p>

<p>"I do; and he is in a very favorable position. He
is a big one, and must be a male," replied Louis, who
stood at the stem with a repeating-rifle in his hand.</p>

<p>"Do you see him, Flix?"</p>

<p>"I do; and he has a green nest in the same tree
with him."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 278px;">

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time all the party had taken their rifles.
The boat moved very slowly. A seaman sounded
the depth with a boathook, and reported eight feet.
As she approached the orang, the brute showed
his teeth, and uttered several successive growls, as
though he understood that danger was near; but
he did not attempt to escape.</p>

<p>"I wonder can the blackguard swim," said Felix,
who had his rifle ready to fire.</p>

<p>"I have read that he is a poor swimmer," replied
Louis.</p>

<p>"How does he get about here where the water
is eight feet deep?"</p>

<p>"He is not as agile as the gibbon; but he can
make his way from one tree to another in the same
manner, and his road is through the trees, and not
on the ground."</p>

<p>"Here I am, and I can't go any farther," said
the captain, as he rang to stop her. "I can't get
the boat through this clump of bushes."</p>

<p>"You are near enough, Captain; let her rest where
she is," replied Louis, as he aimed his rifle at the
orang, which was sitting on a branch holding on with
both hands.</p>

<p>Louis fired, and the creature fell with a loud
splash into the water at the foot of the tree. But
he was not dead, and was struggling to escape. He
was evidently wounded very badly, and when the
hunter saw his opportunity he fired again. The
orang had grasped a screw-pine, and he held on, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he struggled no more. The captain had ordered the
sampan to be brought alongside, and two men were
at the paddles. Louis and Felix joined them, and
they paddled towards the <i>game</i>.</p>

<p>"I think he is dead though he still holds on at
the bush," said Louis.</p>

<p>"We shall soon find out," added Clingman, as
he threw a slip-noose over his head. "Heave ahead
now!" he continued, as Clinch grasped the line
with him, and they pulled together.</p>

<p>The orang did not make any movement, and it
was certain that he was dead. When they had
drawn him within a few feet of the sampan, the line
was made fast, and the men paddled to the steamer.
A purchase was rigged to the top of one of the stanchions,
and the dead animal was hoisted into the
sampan.</p>

<p>"Now, Lane, measure him," said the captain.</p>

<p>The body was laid out at full length in the bottom
of the boat; and the carpenter took his length on a
boathook, which he notched to indicate the height of
the animal. He was directed to take several other
measurements; in fact, Louis kept him at work for
over an hour, with another hand to assist him in
spreading out the limbs. The captain became quite
impatient; for he was less a scientist than the young
millionaire, though he had a taste for natural history.</p>

<p>"Have you finished, Louis?" asked Scott as the
former returned to the yacht.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"All done; but Lane must sum up the results,"
replied Louis.</p>

<p>"What good will all those measurements do you?"
demanded the captain rather contemptuously.</p>

<p>"They will not put any money in my pocket, but I
want to know the size of the game I have killed,"
answered Louis, somewhat nettled by the manner of
Scott. "When a man has caught a fish he wants to
know what his prize weighs."</p>

<p>"All right; but I want to get a little farther into
the woods here, and I can get around the bushes
ahead of her," replied the captain, who had been
studying up a course by which he could go a considerable
distance farther inland.</p>

<p>He backed the boat, and then went ahead very
slowly, with Clingman feeling of the bottom with the
boathook. It was novel sailing through the forest in
a steam-launch, and all hands enjoyed it. The screw-pines
were rather scattered, and the forest of large
trees was quite open. After the boat had gone about
half a mile, as the captain judged, Clingman made
a report.</p>

<p>"By the mark, one," said he, as the depth is given
with the lead, in fathoms.</p>

<p>"Six feet; we are shoaling," added Captain Scott.
"Try it again."</p>

<p>"Five feet," returned the seaman.</p>

<p>The steamer continued on her course, with Scott at
the wheel, for some time longer. The dry land could
be seen through the trees at no great distance ahead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The boat continued on her course for a quarter of an
hour, when Clingman call out a depth which caused
the captain to ring the gong to stop her. The last
report was three feet, and the keel was evidently
grinding through the soft mud. Then he rang to
back her; and when she had increased her depth to
four feet, he struck the gong to stop her.</p>

<p>"Dinner is ready, gentlemen," said Pitts.</p>

<p>"We must attend to that before we do anything
more," added the captain. "Keep a sharp lookout
ahead, Clingman."</p>

<p>The party went into the after cabin, and the novelty
of dining on board of a steamer in the woods was
sufficiently inspiring to add a big interest to the occasion.</p>

<p>"What have you got for dinner, Pitts?" asked
Felix, as he entered the cabin. "Have you got any
stewed crocodiles?"</p>

<p>"Not a croc, Mr. McGavonty," replied the cook.</p>

<p>"Any boiled orang-outang?"</p>

<p>"Not an orang. The captain bought six dozens of
eggs at the village where we stopped yesterday, and
I have ham and eggs for dinner, which I hope will
suit you," replied Pitts.</p>

<p>"The best thing in the world for me. Whisper!
Are they crocodiles' eggs?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, sir."</p>

<p>The principal dish proved to be very satisfactory
to the boys, whose appetites had been sharpened by
the exercise of the forenoon. The cuisine had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
very good along the rivers, for Pitts had generally
been the caterer as well as the cook and steward.
Chickens and eggs had been plentiful enough, and at
the town he had obtained some fish. There was no
fresh beef or mutton. They had a barrel of excellent
salt beef from the stores of the ship; and Pitts made
a splendid hash, which suited all hands better than
almost anything else.</p>

<p>While they were at dinner the steward brought in
Lane's report of the measurements of the orang Louis
had shot. It was given to the Captain at the head
of the table; and he read it off: "Height, 4 feet, 5&frac14;
inches; arms spread out full length, from end to end
of longest fingers, 7 feet, 10 inches; length of arm,
3 feet, 3 inches; length of hand, 10&frac12; inches; length
of foot, 12&frac14; inches; round the waist, 4 feet, 2 inches.
Four men estimated on the weight, and the average
is 185 pounds.'"</p>

<p>"Big mias," said Achang.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can skin and stuff him,
Achang?" asked Louis.</p>

<p>"Know I can; have done it with naturalist."</p>

<p>"Then you may go to work on it as soon as you
please, and I will give you five dollars for the job,"
added Louis. "Take your time, and do it well."</p>

<p>"Where I work? Sampan no good."</p>

<p>"I can make a place in the waist," said the captain;
"besides, I want the small boat, for we can see
higher land farther in, and I wish to go ashore there;
we may find some shooting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The boxes and barrels were moved farther forward
and aft, and a workshop made for the Bornean.
The sampan was cleaned out when the hands had finished
their dinner, and the "Big Four," embarked in
it. They did their own paddling, for there was not
room enough for any more in the boat without crowding.
Each of them carried a rifle. It was but a
short distance, and the party were soon on the dry
land.</p>

<p>Louis had hardly put his feet on the shore when
he levelled his gun and fired. A moment later Felix
followed his example; and each of them had brought
down a deer. They rushed forward to secure their
game; and then the other two hunters discharged
their rifles, and a couple of wild pigs rolled over
on the ground. It was plain that they had struck
a spot where hunters seldom came. If there was
any more game near, the report of the guns had
driven it off.</p>

<p>"That was pretty well for a five minutes' hunt,"
said Louis when he and Felix had dragged the two
deer to the water. "I think we had better stay here
over night, and hunt on high ground to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't do, Louis, and I should not dare
to keep the Blanchita here over night," replied
Captain Scott.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"The water is high and low up here by turns, and
I am afraid I should find the yacht on the bottom
in the morning," replied Scott. "Then we could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not get her out of the woods, and might have to stay
here a week or two, waiting for water to float her.
No, no; I won't take the risk."</p>

<p>The game was dragged to the shore, and loaded
into the sampan; for the appalling picture the captain
had made of low water induced them all to hurry
on board of the yacht.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>A FORMIDABLE OBSTRUCTION REMOVED</h3>


<p>The deer shot by Felix was a little fellow, though
he was full grown, Achang said, when it was taken
on board the yacht. The one killed by Louis was
much larger. The pigs were in better condition than
the one shot before. The men were set at work to
skin the deer, and the cook cut out the best parts
of the two swine. There was plenty of salt pork in
the stores, so that the sides were not needed.</p>

<p>Achang kept himself very busy in his workshop.
He had a difficult job on his hands; for he had to skin
the fingers and toes of the animal, and to keep every
part in its original shape. Captain Scott went to
the wheel as soon as he came on board, and started
the engine. Clingman reported the depth of water the
same as when the party went on shore. By backing
and going ahead a short distance at a time, he
got the boat about, and headed her for the river.</p>

<p>The water was deep enough, and there was no
particular difficulty in the navigation, though he was
to follow the course he had taken at first. He had
carefully observed the shape and location of the trees,
and the stream was reached in a short time. Louis
declared that it was a great pity they could not re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>main
near the high ground, for he had no doubt that
plenty of game would have been found.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that we have got all the game we
want," said Scott. "What could we do with a couple
more deer and a brace of wild hogs?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right; but the fellows want to
hunt, though I think I have had enough of it. I
enjoy the sailing up this river, and it will be pleasant
to explore the lakes farther up the stream," added
Louis.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall get to some place where we can
do some fishing for a change; besides, I am fish
hungry," replied Scott.</p>

<p>"Most of the fishing here is done with the tuba
plant; and I think it is mean to stupefy the fish,
and then pick them up on the top of the water. But
the river is clearer up this way, and we will drop
our lines when we come to a good place."</p>

<p>"If you want to do any more shooting just now,
there is a flock of long-noses" (by which he meant
proboscis monkeys), said the captain, as he pointed
to them.</p>

<p>"We have one good specimen of that creature, and
I don't want any more at present; but I would give
something to know why they prefer to be in trees
which grow out of the water," added Louis.</p>

<p>"I give it up, for I don't see any reason for it;
but I suppose the long-nose understands the matter
himself, and he won't tell us. Here we are at the
river."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain rang the speed-bell as the steamer entered
the stream where it was only thirty feet wide.
There was a considerable current, and the screw-pines
were densely packed together on both sides.
The boat continued on her course for half an hour
longer, when she seemed to have come to the end
of all things, and the gong rang to stop her.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" exclaimed Scott. "And here
we are likely to remain, unless we back down stream
till we find a place wide enough to turn in."</p>

<p>The obstruction which closed the passage of the
river against the Blanchita was a bridge of dead pines
which the current had brought down, and they had
caught at the sides till they formed the barrier. It
was not more than six feet wide, though it might as
well have been a hundred so far as blocking up the
river was concerned.</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of stopping here, for I want
to see the lakes above; and I hoped we might get
some fishing there," said Louis.</p>

<p>"What the matter is?" called Achang from his
workshop.</p>

<p>He moved to one side so that he could see the
obstruction.</p>

<p>"You can go through that, Captain," he continued,
after Morris had corrected his English. "I have
come up here before, and we have cut a way through."</p>

<p>"All right; we will see what the bridge is made
of," said the captain, as he rang to back the boat.</p>

<p>She backed down the stream about twenty rods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and then he stopped her. He then ordered Clingman
to draw a piece of sailcloth over the stem, to prevent
the dead pines from scratching the paint on the bow.
As soon as this was done, she went ahead again at
full speed, and the captain called to the engineer to
give her all the steam he could. She went ahead
at a furious rate, and Scott pointed her to what
seemed to be the weakest place in the barrier.</p>

<p>"Now hold on, fellows, or she will tip you over!"
shouted the captain as the boat approached the obstruction.</p>

<p>She struck the mass of pines, and drove her bow
far into it, but stopped without going through it.
The barrier was not solid, and was held together by
the entanglement of the bushes as they were driven
into the nucleus of the mass by the current.</p>

<p>"We can't cut through in that way," said Scott,
as he looked at the half-sundered bridge.</p>

<p>"We don't want to take the back track," added
Louis.</p>

<p>"There are more ways than one to skin a mosquito,
and we haven't half tried yet," replied the captain.
"The thing is softer than I supposed, and yielded
when the boat hit it. I could go through, but it
would take all the paint off the sides. Get out the
anchor, Clingman, and we will see what can be done."</p>

<p>"I think we shall stick fast enough without anchoring,"
said Morris with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Wait a few minutes, my hearty; for I was not
thinking of coming to anchor just now," answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Scott, as he went forward to the stem, and mounted
the rail.</p>

<p>The anchor was stowed under the forward seat;
and Clingman, after overhauling the cable, passed it
up to the captain. It was not very heavy, and with
a skilful toss he threw it just over the edge of the
barrier on the up-stream side. All wondered what
he was going to do, for they saw no way to get
through by means of the anchor; but they were willing
to believe that the captain knew what he was
about, and they said nothing.</p>

<p>"Now pay out about fifty feet of cable," continued
Scott, as he rang the gong to back her. "Haul
steady on it till you are sure it is fast in the stuff,
Clingman."</p>

<p>The seaman humored the cable till he was unable
to haul the rope home, and then reported the situation.
The boat continued to back till the cable was
hauled taut, when he stopped her. Then he spoke
through the tube to the engineer, and rang the gong.
The craft moved again, but very gently, for Scott
was afraid the anchor would not hold; but it did, and
speaking through the tube, he gradually increased
the speed. The cable swayed and groaned, and it
was evident that a heavy strain was upon it. The
barrier was shaking and quivering under the pressure,
and it was plain that something would yield
very soon.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Felix, who was looking over
the bow at the bridge of pines; and the cry was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
repeated by the rest of the cabin party, and taken up
by the sailors. "Bully for you, Captain Scott!
Upon me wurrud, ye's have skinned the muskitty!"</p>

<p>This demonstration was called forth by the rupture
of the barrier in two places, so that about one-half of
it gave way, and was towed down stream by the
steamer. Scott kept the craft moving till he found a
place in the green banks of the river to leave the
tow, for it was wide enough to obstruct the channel.</p>

<p>"Clingman and Wales, jump on the raft with the
boathooks, and crowd the stuff over to the starboard
side," said the captain when he had found the place
he wanted.</p>

<p>He stopped the boat, and then went ahead, to enable
the men to get upon the mass, after they had
thrown a couple of boards upon it to stand on.
Backing her again, he hugged the starboard side of
the stream, and drew the raft abreast of the place,
and close to it, where it was to be left. The men on
it hooked into the screw-pines, and hauled it into the
opening. Pulling vines from the trees, they moored
it where it was. As soon as the two men came
aboard the boat, the captain went ahead again.</p>

<p>"You did that job handsomely, Captain Scott,"
said Louis. "I thought the only way we could
get through was by cutting a passage for the boat."</p>

<p>"That would have taken too long," replied Scott,
as he called Clinch to the wheel. "Mind your eye!
for the river is very crooked up here. Look out
for the swing as she goes around the bends."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The boat had not gone a great distance when she
came to a considerable expanse of territory which
had been swept over by fire. The party did not
think that the green bushes would burn; but they
had burned so that nothing was left of them but
the blackened stems, and there was no room for an
argument.</p>

<p>"When the fire gets started, it scorches and dries
the bushes till they will burn," Louis explained.
"But what are we coming to now?" he asked,
looking ahead where the country seemed to be level,
and covered with a sheet of water, in which the screw-pines
were abundant.</p>

<p>"That must be one of your lakes, Louis," added
the captain.</p>

<p>"If it is mine, I will sell it to you," replied
he.</p>

<p>"I don't want to buy; but I am not so sure that
we can get through as shoal a place as that seems
to be, for it is only the spreading out of the river.
The greater the expanse, the less the depth. How
is that, Achang?"</p>

<p>"Plenty water; float the boat," answered the Bornean.
"Little Padang Lake. Plenty pandanus."</p>

<p>"What are pandanuses?" asked Scott.</p>

<p>"The plural of the word is pandanace&aelig;; and they
are the same thing as the screw-pines, and sometimes
are found thirty feet high. There is one; and you
can see roots starting out of the stem, and heading
downward. The leaves are very useful to the na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>tives.
We shall get tied in a hard knot if we follow
the twists of this stream much farther."</p>

<p>Presently the boat came to the lake. The captain
was considerably exercised about the depth of water;
and as they entered the lake, which was not very
different from the overflowed region they had visited
that day, he ordered the wheelman to stop her.</p>

<p>"There must be some sort of a channel through
this pond," said he, looking about him. "There is
a bigger lake than this one farther up. There are
mountains in sight in the distance, and the water
from them must find an outlet to the sea."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you are right; and probably
there is a channel through this lake, for its water
must get to the sea, unless it dries up on the way,"
added Louis.</p>

<p>"It will be easier to find this channel near the
river than it will when we are half-way across the
lake;" and the captain sent two men with Morris
in the sampan to search for it.</p>

<p>The water was tolerably clear; and they went to
the mouth of the outlet, sounding all the time with
the boathooks. They found the channel at this
point, and then followed it up beyond the steamer.
Morris shouted that the sampan was in the channel,
and the Blanchita moved into it. The searching-party
returned to the steamer. Morris was the
mate; and, with the two men who had gone with
him, he was directed to keep the run of the deeper
water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>In another half-hour they came to the forest again,
though the trees were growing in the shallow lake.
Achang was hard at work all the time, taking all the
pains with his operation which Louis had required
of him; but his occupation did not prevent him from
looking about him, and he soon made a discovery.</p>

<p>"Mias! Mias!" he shouted, pointing to a tall
tree a few rods from the boat. "Mias fast asleep!"</p>

<p>All the party looked in the direction indicated,
and saw the orang. He was lying on his back in
the crotch of the tree, holding on with both hands
to the branches. He must have been a heavy sleeper
or the puffing of the engine would have aroused him.
But Louis would not fire at him, as Scott suggested.
He had a bigger orang than the one in the tree, and
he did not want another. As he would not fire,
Felix refused to do so, and the mias was left to
finish his nap.</p>

<p>A little later in the day the boat came to Padang
Lake; but they were disappointed when they found
it was filled with screw-pines, though they could
see open water, in one direction quite a large sheet
of it. Following the channel, they reached the open
space. The boat had hardly passed the limit of
the screw-pines before Clingman shouted, "Fish!"</p>

<p>The captain rang the gong, the boat stopped, and
fishlines <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'where'">were</ins> in demand. The flesh of the orang
was used for bait; and in a few minutes Morris
hauled up a fish so large that it taxed all his strength
and skill to get him into the boat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE CAPTAIN'S ASTOUNDING PROPOSITION</h3>


<p>All the cabin party had their lines out, but not
another fish was caught. The place where they
fished seemed to be a hole, and the water was deep
and clear. Perhaps Morris's struggle with the big
fish had scared the others away, for not another
could be seen. The day was done, and it was growing
dark. It was decided to anchor where they were,
and spend the night there; and they hoped the fish
would be in biting condition the next morning.</p>

<p>Achang called the fish the gourami, or something
like that; but beyond this nothing was known about
him. Louis, who was generally posted, could tell his
companions nothing about it. But Pitts had cut it
up, and it was fried for supper. The flesh was hard,
and the flavor excellent. There was enough of it
for all hands, and the supper amounted to a feast.
A heavy thunder-shower made the evening very
gloomy; but the canvas roof and curtains of the
Blanchita fully protected the party from the rain,
which fell in sheets for full two hours.</p>

<p>The next morning when the party turned out,
the weather was as pleasant as they could desire,
and the air was cleared and freshened by the shower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
The first thing they did was to throw over their
lines; for they could see the fish through the clear
water of the lake. In about as many minutes they
had hooked four fish, though not one of them was
so large as the one Morris had caught the evening
before. But at that point they ceased to bite, and
not another nibble was had. Either the fish did not
like the looks of the boat, handsome as she was,
which would have been very bad taste on their part,
or the struggles of those which had been hauled in
frightened them away. Very likely the fish could
have explained the reason for their sudden disappearance;
but they did not, and it remained a mystery.</p>

<p>They had an ice-chest on board, and Mr. Eng had
replenished it at Simujan. Pitts dressed the fish,
and put them in the refrigerator. For breakfast
they had fresh pork, and it was much better than
that they had had before. They had learned to
drink coffee without milk, for it was not often that
it could be procured away from the larger towns.</p>

<p>"I say, fellows, don't you think there can be too
much of a good thing?" asked Captain Scott at the
head of the table.</p>

<p>"Of course there can be too much of a good thing;
for a fellow might eat ice-cream till his throat was
frozen," replied Felix.</p>

<p>"Almost anything becomes a bad thing when you
have too much of it," added Louis. "But I think
we could have stood about four more of those nice
fish. What is the moral of all this, Captain?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"With me the moral is that I have had hunting
enough for the present," replied Scott. "I should
like a little more variety in our daily life."</p>

<p>"I don't think I should care to go hunting more
than one day in a week, or, at most, two," replied
Louis. "We have had it right along for a week;
and, as you suggest, that's too much of a good
thing."</p>

<p>"But it was you, Louis, who went in for three
weeks of it," added the captain.</p>

<p>"Simply because I thought it would take the
Guardian-Mother and the Blanche about that time
to visit Siam and French Cochin-China."</p>

<p>"I suppose if we had made our trip up these rivers
in a sampan, we should not have got so far inland in
another week," added Morris.</p>

<p>"I don't think we should have come up here at all
if the Blanchita had not been available," said Louis.
"But we are close to the mountains now, and I am
in favor of a tramp on shore."</p>

<p>"All right; and after breakfast we will get under
way, for I must attend to the navigation," replied
Scott; "and I suppose Felipe has steam enough by
this time."</p>

<p>They left the table, and Scott went to the wheel.
To save time and trouble, the men took their meals
in the after cabin, and the engineer had the head of
the table. Both Louis and Felix had run the engine
of the Maud a portion of the time on her memorable
voyage from Funchal to Gibraltar, and the former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was sent to the engine-room. The boat went ahead;
and after passing through a section of pandanus, they
came to an open lake, which they judged to be five
miles long.</p>

<p>The water was shallow, though deep enough for
the steamer. The captain opened the binnacle, and
headed the Blanchita to the north. It was a very
quiet time, and the boat went along at her usual
speed. In little less than half an hour she reached
the head of the lake; but there was no convenient
landing-place for a craft of her draught, and she
was anchored at a considerable distance from the
shore. Achang and two of the seamen were directed
to attend the "Big Four," and they were
landed in the sampan.</p>

<p>Each of the cabin party took his fowling-piece,
while Achang had a rifle, and each of the sailors
carried one, the latter to be used by the young men
if they were wanted. They had walked but a short
distance before they came to a steep precipice about
twenty feet high, at which a notched log had been
placed by some former visitors, as they supposed;
but as soon as they had mounted it, they came upon
a Dyak long-house, which might have been better
called a short-house, for it contained but six doors,
and therefore the tax upon the village need not
have caused any grumbling.</p>

<p>The dwelling was not now a novelty, neither were
the Dyak men and maidens; for the latter were not
as pretty as several they had seen on the river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
They were very hospitable, and invited the party to
enter the house, which they did; but there was little
to interest them there. Achang talked with them,
and the head man said they caught plenty of fish in
the lake, and they snared pigs, deer, monkeys, and
other game. He engaged a couple of guides for the
mountains.</p>

<p>The game was plentiful, and the hunters shot several
deer, a pig, and a Malay bear; but they were not
enthusiastic hunters, considering that they had come
to Borneo for that purpose. After a four hours'
tramp they all thought they had had enough of it.
Felix declared that he preferred to hunt cobras and
tigers, for all the game seemed to be very tame to
him. Seating themselves on the ground, they rested
for an hour, and then started on their return to the
boat. All the game was given to the Dyak guides,
who were very glad to get it. They swung it on a
pole, and trotted along with their load as though it
had been no burden at all.</p>

<p>"They do that all day," said Achang. "Never get
tired."</p>

<p>"They have load enough to feed the village for a
week," added the captain. "I should not care for the
fun of feeding them another week, for I find hunting
here very tame business."</p>

<p>"My sintimints also," added Felix.</p>

<p>After a walk of another hour they reached the
Dyak house, and the whole population of the place
followed them to the shore. They were filled with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
wonder and admiration at the sight of the Blanchita,
and went off to her in their sampans. They were
permitted to go on board; but when Felipe fed the
fire in the furnace, and the steam began to hiss, some
of them were frightened, and fled to their boats.</p>

<p>Dinner was all ready when the party went on
board; and Achang was instructed to send off the
guests, for the boat was to get under way at once.
They got into their sampans; but they remained near
the Blanchita, evidently desirous to see her sail.
They had not to wait long, for the anchor was
weighed, and the captain rang the gong. She went
off at her usual speed, and the Dyaks expressed their
astonishment in various ways.</p>

<p>"Dinner all ready, gentlemen," said Pitts as soon
as the steamer was well under way.</p>

<p>"What have you for dinner, Pitts?" asked the
captain.</p>

<p>"Baked fish, Captain, in two pieces; for he was
too long to go into my oven," replied the cook.</p>

<p>"All right. Take the wheel, Clingman, and make
the course due south."</p>

<p>"Due south, sir," repeated the wheelman.</p>

<p>The party hastened to the after cabin; for they
were hungry after their long tramp, though they had
taken a light lunch with them. The fish, "in two
pieces," was placed before the captain; while Pitts
stood by his side, ready to pass the plates, and hear
any comments the captain might make on the principal
viand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The odor from the steaming fish was emphatically
agreeable to the hungry hunters, and so was the soft
divan to their tired legs. Scott helped the members
of the party to liberal portions of the dainty dish,
and without pausing for manners they began to
partake. When the captain had tasted the fish, he
stopped short, and looked at Pitts. Then he reached
out his right hand to him.</p>

<p>"Your hand, Pitts!" and the cook took it, his face
wreathed in smiles. "You have cooked a dish here,
Pitts, which is fit for any king on the continent of
Europe, to say nothing of Asia."</p>

<p>The rest of the party applauded vigorously, and
every one of them, following the example of the
captain, took the cook by the hand, and bestowed
additional praise upon him; and Louis declared that
he could not have done better if he had served his
time as a <i>cuisinier</i> in the Grand Hotel in Paris.
But the most telling tribute to the skill of the cook
was in the amount consumed; and the captain expressed
a fear that the engineer and five seamen
would have to "kiss the cook."</p>

<p>"It is only a woman cook that gets served in that
way, and then not unless she is good looking," replied
Pitts, laughing. "But you need have no fear,
Captain, and the second table will have no occasion
to kiss the cook, even it were one of the pretty girls
we saw at the long-house below; for I have another
fish in the oven, and it will be done by the time they
are ready for it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right, Pitts; look out for the men as well
as you do for the rest of us," added the captain.
"Now, fellows, I am going to the wheel; and I want
to see all of you in the fore cabin, for I have something
to say, and we may have occasion to vote."</p>

<p>"Vote on what, Captain?" inquired Felix.</p>

<p>"There is no motion before the house, Flix; and
when morning comes the sun will rise, not before,"
replied Captain Scott.</p>

<p>As soon as a plum-pudding had been disposed of,
the party hastened to the fore cabin; for their curiosity
had been excited by what had been said. The
captain took the wheel; and Louis went to the engine,
though he could hear what was said while near
enough to the levers to act in case of need. Scott
had brought from his berth in the after cabin a blue-colored
roll, which all understood was a chart, though
of what sea they did not know.</p>

<p>"Now, fellows, I have come to the conclusion that
we are all tired of paddling about the muddy rivers
of Borneo," the captain began, after he had scrutinized
the compass in the binnacle. "I have said so
before; though I have not enlarged on the subject, or
spoken half as strongly as I might. The rest of you
may not take my view of the situation; but I do not
ask you to do so, and I hope you will all speak out
just what you think, as I have done, and shall do
stronger than before. We want something that is
not quite so tame as shooting pigs and crocodiles at
thirty-six cents a foot."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am quite of your opinion, Captain," added
Morris. "I don't think there is any more fun in
shooting orangs, for we are not naturalists nor scientists
of any sort. If we had brought a naturalist
with us, we should have done better."</p>

<p>"I have had enough of it for the present; but
we have two weeks yet before the ship will come to
Kuching for us, and what are we to do during that
time?" said Louis, walking a little nearer to the
wheel.</p>

<p>"That is precisely the conundrum I intend to guess
on the present occasion, and for which I have called
this meeting without consulting Mr. Belgrave," replied
Captain Scott, giving the wheel to Morris, with the
course, and unfolding the blue roll. "The Guardian-Mother
will go to Saigon before she comes back to
Sarawak. That is about a two days' run for her.
From Sarawak, or the mouth of the river, the distance
is five hundred sea miles. Now, to flash it on
you all at once, I propose to sail in the Blanchita to
Point Cambodia, where the ship will pick us up as
she comes down the Gulf of Siam. Now I am ready
to hear you all groan."</p>

<p>"It looks like a risky voyage in such a craft as
this steam-launch," said Louis, when there was a
prolonged silence.</p>

<p>"I wish you all to look over the chart of the
China Sea; this meeting is adjourned to the after
cabin at four o'clock, and you may do your groaning
there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The men soon came out of the after cabin, and
Pitts was busy removing the dishes and putting
everything in order. At the time stated, the party
were seated around the table in the after cabin, ready
to consider the captain's astounding proposition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>DOWN THE SIMUJAN AND UP THE SARAWAK</h3>


<p>The proposition of Captain Scott was certainly an
astounding one, not unlike the daring of those men
who have crossed the Atlantic in a dory or in small
sailboats; and so it struck the other members of the
cabin party. Scott was not a reckless navigator; and
his companions had voyaged with him on stormy seas
several times in the Maud, though she was a better
sea-going craft than the Blanchita. She was decked
over her entire length, so that she could be closed as
tight as the inside of a barrel, while the steam-launch
was an open boat.</p>

<p>Scott did not regard the venture as an extremely
perilous one, though he would not have thought of
such a thing as crossing the Atlantic in a craft like
the Blanchita, principally because she could not
carry coal enough to render the trip a prudent risk.
The distance from land to land was about five hundred
miles, and the little steamer could easily make
this distance inside of three days. But the captain
must speak for himself.</p>

<p>"Now, fellows, you can study the chart for yourselves,"
said he, as he put the point of his pencil on
the mouth of the Sarawak River. "If the Blanchita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
were a sailing-craft instead of a steamer, I should
not have a moment's hesitation; for though she is
not heavy and clumsy, she is very strongly built. I
have looked her over several times, with this trip in
my head."</p>

<p>"But she can be rigged as a sailing-craft, and has
a short mast and a sail," interposed Morris. "I
talked with the rajah about her, and he told me that
he had been out to sea in her. He said he had never
had occasion to use the sail, but he carried it in case
anything should happen to the engine."</p>

<p>"That betters the situation very materially," replied
the captain. "If we have anything to depend
upon if the engine should break down or the coal
should give out we should be all right."</p>

<p>"There must be heavy seas out in the China Sea,"
added Louis, as he looked over the chart.</p>

<p>"We haven't seen any very heavy seas in any of
these waters. The south-west monsoons prevail at
this season of the year in these waters. I don't find
any decided ocean current laid down on the charts of
the southern and western portions of the China Sea.
They strike in at the eastward of Java, and flow
to the eastward of Borneo, through the Macassar
Strait," said Scott, pointing out the direction on the
chart.</p>

<p>"That looks favorable; and if there is any current
to speak of, it runs in the direction of the monsoons,
and therefore will not be likely to cause heavy
winds."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I thought the trip was a very dangerous one, I
certainly should not propose to make it," added the
captain.</p>

<p>"Fish!" shouted Clingman at the wheel.</p>

<p>In spite of their interest in the discussion, all the
party rushed forward at this cry. The captain ordered
the wheelman to stop her, though her headway
kept her moving for some minutes after the screw
ceased to revolve. The men baited the hooks as soon
as fish were indicated. The boat had reached the
locality where the catch of the day before had been
obtained, and all hands were on the lookout. The
lines were thrown over, and the fish bit quickly as
soon as the steamer was at rest. In half an hour
they had taken seven.</p>

<p>"Keep her moving, Clingman," said Captain Scott,
as the party hurried back to the cabin to continue
the discussion.</p>

<p>Pitts dressed the fish, and put them in the ice-chest.
Achang had completed the skinning of the
orang, and the skin was now drying in the sun.
The voyage to Siam or Cambodia looked very much
like an adventure, and the young men were deeply
interested in it.</p>

<p>"I don't think we are likely to encounter any
very heavy weather in the western part of the China
Sea," said Captain Scott, as he put his pencil on
the chart again. "We may be overhauled by a
typhoon."</p>

<p>"And what is a typhoon?" asked Felix. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
know it is some sort of a storm, and that is all
I do know."</p>

<p>"There are different names for a storm in different
parts of the earth," replied Scott. "What is
a hurricane in the West Indies is a cyclone in the
northern part of the Indian Ocean, and a typhoon
in the China Sea. They are all alike in substance,
being revolving storms, in which the wind whirls
around in a circle, and at the same time has a
forward movement as a whole towards some point
of the compass. But there are various signs which
indicate the approach of a typhoon or a hurricane;
and in these seas the barometer has to be watched
constantly."</p>

<p>"I suppose we should be out of sight of land about
all the time on the passage," suggested Morris.</p>

<p>"Not at all, my lad; for the first two hundred
miles of the course we should not be out of sight
of land half of the time, or only for a few hours
at a time. Now look at the chart, all of you.
Here we are at the mouth of the Sarawak River.
About a hundred miles west of that is Cape Datu,
the most western point of Borneo. Then for two
hundred miles there is a chain of islands extending
to the north-west, which is our course. These
are the Natuna Islands; the largest one takes the
same name, and is forty miles long. There are
several other small islands north of this one, and
if the weather came on very bad we could make
a lee under one of them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Channel, sir!" shouted Clingman.</p>

<p>"I think you have got an idea of the whole
thing, and we have a couple of days to think of
it," said the captain, as he rose from his seat. "I
will leave the chart here, and you can all study it."</p>

<p>Scott went forward to the wheel. He had caused
a red rag to be tied to the top of a screw-pine
while the sampan was looking for a channel through
the lake, and Clingman had stopped the boat abreast
of it. The captain took the helm himself; and he
had carefully observed various marks, and obtained
the bearings of the mountain, and other prominent
objects which might assist him in taking the steamer
through the shallow lake. He started her at once,
and rang the speed-bell confidently, as though he
had been through the lake a dozen times before.</p>

<p>It was sunset when the boat entered the narrow
river, and they were called to supper. Clinch was
placed at the wheel. It was a good moon, and the
boat continued on her course till she came to the
Dyak village where they had visited the long-house.
She had been seen or heard as she approached;
and the whole village was on the shore, including
Mr. Eng.</p>

<p>"We are not going to lie up to-night," said Captain
Scott when asked to land. "We are somewhat
in a hurry to get back to Kuching, and we shall
run down to Simujan this evening."</p>

<p>"I am going in the morning, Captain," added
the agent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tow you down, and you can sleep on
board if you wish."</p>

<p>"Thank you; my men will come down with the
sampans to-morrow, and I gladly accept your offer,"
replied Mr. Eng. "But I must first go over to
the <i>pangah</i>."</p>

<p>"To what? Will it take long?" inquired the
captain.</p>

<p>"The pangah, or head-house of the village. I
left my portmanteau there, and must get it."</p>

<p>"The head-house! May we go with you? for
we did not stop to look at it when we were here
before."</p>

<p>"Certainly you may go with me; I will have
some torches so that you can see it as well as in the
daytime," replied the agent, as he started with the
cabin party, attended by four Dyaks who had come
to the river with torches. "No head-hunting has
been done for many years, as you are aware, and
not many heads are on exhibition. In some villages
you will find them by the hundred, though the people
here were never much given to the barbarous practice.
It was not necessary in this part of the island
that a young man should get a head before a girl
would accept him as her husband. Here it is."</p>

<p>It was a circular building not far from fifty feet
in diameter, with a conical roof. In the centre was
a place for a fire, which was perhaps required in
cleaning the abominable trophies of war or individual
murders. All around the apartment was a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
divan, or bench, while over it were hung up the
skulls, all nicely cleaned in the first instance, but
now darkened by the smoke.</p>

<p>"This is the public building of the village, and
the council when it meets has its place here for deliberation
and action," said Mr. Eng, when he had
pointed out what was to be seen in the building.</p>

<p>"Rather a sombre place, I should say, for such a
purpose," suggested Louis.</p>

<p>"When you got used to the skulls you would not
mind them any more than you would any other dry
bones," laughed the agent. "I slept here last night,
and the young men and boys lodge here. If you
were to remain over night, young gentlemen, you
would be quartered here; for it is the home of the
stranger who visits the village."</p>

<p>"Then, I should be very thankful that we had a
cabin in our steamer," replied Louis. "But there
is no accounting for tastes."</p>

<p>The agent gave his baggage to a Dyak, and the
party returned to the boat. A bed in the cabin was
prepared for Mr. Eng, who said he was very tired,
for he had walked a great distance that day, and he
retired at once. The captain took the first watch,
with two of the men. It was plain sailing, and in
the middle of the night the Blanchita was anchored
in the river in front of the kampon. Scott turned
in then, with one of the port watch on duty.</p>

<p>In the morning they could not be induced to accept
Mr. Eng's pressing invitation to remain a day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
or two at Simujan. He promised to take them to
the coal and gold mine if they would remain; but
all of them were so full of the great project that
the invitation was declined. Three of the fish were
presented to the agent, who told them something
about it, and declared that it was the finest fish on
the island.</p>

<p>A quantity of ice was obtained at the town; and
Pitts carefully packed the rest of the fish, which
were still hard and in nice condition. The captain
desired to present a couple of them to Rajah Brooke,
and some of the others to officers who had been
very kind to them, and had assisted them in many
ways. In the early morning they bade a grateful
adieu to the agent, and departed on the trip to
Kuching.</p>

<p>The tide was going out, and they made a quick
passage to the sea. On their arrival there they
found a stiff south-west wind blowing, and the bay
covered with white-caps. They had not tried the
Blanchita in anything like a heavy sea, though the
rajah had declared that she was a very able and
weatherly sea-boat. Captain Scott was very glad of
the opportunity to test her behavior in rough weather.
He went to the helm himself as the boat came out of
the Sadong. The very first wave that broke on her
bow scattered the spray from stem to stern.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The boat rose gracefully on the billows.</span></span><br />
<div class='right'><a href="#Page_132"><i>Page 132.</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>Scott ordered the men to batten down the curtains
on the weather side. But the boat rose gracefully
on the billows, and did not scoop up any water in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
doing so. Boxes, barrels, and other movable articles
were secured, and the captain was delighted with
the working of the boat.</p>

<p>"I don't want any better sea-boat than the Blanchita,"
said he with great enthusiasm. "I doubt if
we get it any rougher than this on the voyage to
Cambodia Point."</p>

<p>"Unless we run into a typhoon," said Morris, who
was observing the conduct of the boat with quite as
much interest as his superior officer.</p>

<p>"We won't run into a typhoon," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"How can you help yourself? As sailors we
must take things as they come."</p>

<p>"If navigators have a thousand miles or more of
ocean ahead of them, they must face the music.
But among these islands, if the weather looks typhoony,
we can get under a lee, or make a harbor
in some bay. But don't try to cross the bridge till
we get to it, Morris."</p>

<p>"Sail, ho!" shouted Clingman.</p>

<p>It was a steamer about as far off as she could be
made out. The two craft were approaching each
other, and the steamer from the west went into the
Sarawak ahead of the Blanchita. She was a small
vessel, apparently of not more than three hundred
tons. It soon became evident that she was not a fast
sailer, for the Blanchita held her own with her all
the way up the river to Kuching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>ON THE VOYAGE TO POINT CAMBODIA</h3>


<p>The Blanchita moored as usual in front of the
town, while the steamer anchored in the river. She
proved to be the Delhi, from Calcutta; and it was
ascertained when the party went on shore later, that
she was to sail for Saigon the next day. The first
care of the cabin party was to send the fish to Rajah
Brooke and two officers whose acquaintance they had
made.</p>

<p>Pitts overhauled the ice-chest, and found them in
excellent condition; and Achang was appointed to be
the bearer of them, with the compliments of the
Americans, to the gentlemen who were to receive
them. Two native porters were to carry them; and
the party knew that the fish were a rarity in the
town, and they were in season for the dinner of that
day.</p>

<p>The four went on shore together just as a party
from the Delhi landed with a boat. The captain of
the steamer hailed them in the street in front of the
government house, and asked if they belonged to the
steam-launch which had just come up the river.
He was curious to know something more about the
explorers, and Captain Scott told him what they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
been doing in the island. He was invited on board
of the Blanchita, and was much interested in the
young men.</p>

<p>They showed him over the boat; and he was
greatly pleased with the craft, and with the excellent
accommodations for sleeping, eating, and making the
voyagers generally comfortable. They came to the
ice-chest, in which two of the choice fish still remained;
and Scott presented one of them to their
guest.</p>

<p>"We intend to sail for Point Cambodia to-morrow
to rejoin our ship," said the captain of the Blanchita,
after the fish had been sent on board.</p>

<p>"In this little tub of yours?" asked the commander
of the Delhi with a smile of incredulity.</p>

<p>"Is this part of the China Sea subject to violent
seas?"</p>

<p>"Not at just this season of the year. With the
south-west monsoons smart squalls come up sometimes,
but they are not very bad. I don't think you
will find it any rougher than we had it outside the
river to-day on your passage to the Point," replied
Captain Rayburn, who stated then that he had seen
the Guardian-Mother when she was at Calcutta.</p>

<p>"You are bound to Saigon, I think you said."</p>

<p>"To Saigon, but a portion of my cargo goes to
Kampot. If I found a sailing-vessel here that was
going up the Gulf of Siam, I was ordered to reship
my freight for Kampot in her; if not, I was to take
it there in the Delhi. I find no such vessel here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you will make your course direct for Point
Cambodia, Captain Rayburn?" said Scott.</p>

<p>"Precisely so; and if you can keep up with my
steamer, we need not part company on the voyage."</p>

<p>"I think we can keep up with you," replied the
captain of the Blanchita with a smile.</p>

<p>The party went on shore again, and arrangements
were made for taking in a supply of coal early the
next morning. Everything on board of the yacht
had been stowed very carefully on the passage from
Simujan, in order to make all the room possible for
coal; but the boat could carry a supply for four
days, and Scott was not at all afraid that he should
come short of this needed article. Pitts purchased
all the provisions and stores needed for the voyage.</p>

<p>After dinner the four paid their respects to the
rajah, and visited the two officers whose acquaintance
they had made. They were heartily thanked for the
welcome gift of the fish, which the officers declared
were a great luxury; and Governor Brooke said that
he should make a trip to the lake where they were
caught, in the government steam-yacht. These
gentlemen thought the young men were rather venturesome
to undertake the voyage before them in so
small a craft; but the best wishes of all of them
went with the party.</p>

<p>At daylight in the morning the coaling was begun;
the provisions and stores were all looked over, and
all deficiencies were supplied. By nine o'clock everything
was in readiness for sailing. Captain Rayburn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
sent word that the Delhi would sail at ten o'clock,
and afterwards went on board of the Blanchita.</p>

<p>"You seem to be well supplied with coal," said
he, as he looked about him.</p>

<p>"I think we have a five-days' supply on board,"
replied Scott. "As I figure it up, we shall make the
run to the Point inside of three days."</p>

<p>"The Delhi's time is sixty-three hours," added her
commander. "If your coal should come short, I can
help you out; but I think you won't need it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain Rayburn; that kind offer
removes the only doubt I have in regard to the voyage,"
replied Captain Scott.</p>

<p>"The Delhi, as you have seen for yourself, is not
a fast steamer; but the only fear I have is that you
will not be able to keep up with her," added Captain
Rayburn. "I am obliged to sail in the interest of
my owners, and I must make the best time I can.
The south-west monsoons prevail at this season; and
by carrying sail I may add half a knot, or perhaps
a knot, to her speed. I should be sorry to run away
from you, but I must do my duty."</p>

<p>"Certainly; that is understood. If you run away
from me, I shall still wish you <i>bon voyage</i>. But suppose
I should run away from you?" suggested Scott,
laughing.</p>

<p>"You will be quite welcome to do so. The Delhi
is an old steamer, and not up to modern-built ones;
but with a breeze I have made nine knots in her."</p>

<p>"I shall try to keep up with you, for I should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
very sorry to have to part company with so pleasant
a captain as you are."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain Scott; and if we part company
on the voyage, I hope we shall meet again. I
am liable to be detained some time in Saigon; for
mine is a tramp steamer, and I have to look up a
cargo for some port," said Captain Rayburn, as he
shook hands with the four, and went into his boat
alongside.</p>

<p>The first thing Scott did was to look up the mast
and sail of the Blanchita. It had not been covered
up with coal, as he had feared; for Clingman had
suspended it inboard under the rail. The sail had
been stowed away in the bow of the boat, and it
was brought out and overhauled. It was nearly new,
and needed no repairs. It was a lug-foresail, with a
gaff, but no boom. It was stepped just abaft the
galley, and the sail could be set in two or three minutes
when it was required.</p>

<p>The statement of the captain of the Delhi that he
could gain a knot or less in a good breeze had stimulated
Scott to be ready for such an emergency. The
wind would be on the port quarter during the whole
voyage, and the sail would certainly add something
to the speed of the yacht. In the crowd that collected
at the government storehouse were the rajah
and most of the officers of the place. The handshaking
was all done over again, and pleasant wishes
were extended to the "Big Four" as the Blanchita
cast off her fasts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The Delhi was already under way, and going at
full speed down the river. Clingman was at the
wheel, and Scott went aft to the engine-room, as it
was called, though there was no such room, and the
word applied simply to the locality; and the same
was true of the galley. The boat had been delayed
a little while the party were making and receiving
the parting salutations of their friends, and the
Delhi had a lead of nearly half a mile.</p>

<p>"Give her a spurt, Felipe," said the captain. "I
want to know if that craft has the ability to run
away from us."</p>

<p>The engineer threw more coal into the furnace; and
in a few minutes he "let her out," as the captain
called it. It was very soon perceived that the yacht
was gaining on the old steamer, and Scott became
correspondingly happy. She was farther down in
the water than usual on account of the extra quantity
of coal in her bunkers, and all along her sides, to
trim her properly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe the Delhi will run away from us,
Louis," said the captain as the millionaire joined
him, curious to know what he was doing. "She
isn't loaded for her best sailing, but she is doing first-rate
for her present trim."</p>

<p>"This is smooth water, Captain; what will she do
when we get out to sea?" asked Louis.</p>

<p>"We had a chance to try her yesterday in more
than half a gale, and she behaved like a lady on a
dancing-floor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"But she was not loaded down with coal then as
she is now."</p>

<p>"The extra weight will not disturb her; on the
contrary, I think it will make her steadier."</p>

<p>"I talked with the rajah on board, who has used
her for over a year, and has made a trip to Rangoon
in her. He said she was usually run at eight knots
an hour; but on his return voyage, when he was in
a hurry, she made nine knots for twelve hours together,"
Louis explained.</p>

<p>"That is all I want of her; but I shall not drive
her up to that unless the Delhi is likely to run away
from us; and not then till after I have added the
sail to our power of locomotion. We are coming
up with her now, and probably Captain Rayburn's
fears that his steamer may run away from us
are beginning to abate," said the captain, rubbing
his hands in his delight at the performance of the
Blanchita.</p>

<p>Rather for the occupation it gave him, Scott took
the wheel himself, directing Clingman to call the
men, and remove the stanchions and connecting-rods
on the starboard side of the boat from the galley to
the length of the mast aft, so that the sail might not
be obstructed when it was set.</p>

<p>Then, while the Blanchita was still making her
nine knots, he ran her alongside the Delhi on the
port side, keeping at a safe distance from her. Then
he called to Felipe to reduce the speed to eight knots.
He had gained nearly half a mile in going half-way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
down the river to the sea; and this fully satisfied
him.</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Captain!" shouted Captain Rayburn
from the quarter-deck of his steamer.</p>

<p>"I won't run away from you!" returned Scott, as
the noise of escaping steam when the engineer reduced
the speed must have reached his ears.</p>

<p>"Wait till we get out to sea!" called the captain
of the Delhi.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>The two craft kept abreast of each other till they
had passed the mountain at the mouth of the river.
The captain laid the course north-west half-west;
and this was to be the course for half the distance
to Point Cambodia, as he remarked to Louis, who was
at his side observing the progress of the yacht.</p>

<p>"How do you spell that word, Captain Scott?"
asked Louis.</p>

<p>"Just as I spelled it when I went to school, and it
is so put down on my chart; but I noticed in Black's
"Atlas" that it was spelled Camboja instead of
Cambodia," replied Scott. "I am a sailor, and I
stick to the chart."</p>

<p>"I see that Captain Rayburn has laid his course;
how does it agree with yours, Captain?" inquired
Louis, when they were a mile off the mountain.</p>

<p>"I should say that it was identically the same. I
will hail him."</p>

<p>"North-west half-west," was the answer returned
by the captain of the Delhi.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"I make it the same," replied Scott.</p>

<p>The cabin party were summoned to dinner at this
time, and Clingman was called to the wheel.</p>

<p>"What's the bill of fare to-day?" asked Scott as
he took his seat at the table.</p>

<p>"Baked fish and roast venison," replied Pitts,
"with plum-duff."</p>

<p>"Very good," returned the captain. "We don't
get so much breeze off here as we did yesterday,
Louis."</p>

<p>"It does not look at all rough off at sea," added
the captain. "But when we get Cape Datu on the
beam, we may feel it more."</p>

<p>The Delhi had not yet set her foresail, for she was
schooner-rigged, and there was not wind enough to
help her much; all the rest of the day the two craft
kept abreast of each other, as they had in coming
down the river. After supper the watches were
arranged for the night. The captain, with Clingman
and Lane, had the first, or starboard watch, while
Morris, the mate, had the port watch, with Wales
and Clinch.</p>

<p>Louis and Felix were appointed second engineers,
as the seamen on board relieved them from duty as
deck-hands; and the three in that department were to
keep four-hour watches, like the officers and seamen.
Achang wanted something to do; and he was given
the berth of second mate, and as such he served in
charge of the captain's watch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>AN EXCITING RACE IN THE CHINA SEA</h3>


<p>Everything worked as smoothly on board of the
Blanchita as though she had been in commission for
years, for there was not a green hand in the cabin or
forecastle. The experience obtained by the "Four" in
the Maud had made them proficients in the duties of
their present positions. Louis and Felix were not
trained engineers or machinists; though they were
familiar with the machine, which was of very simple
construction. Both of them were competent to run
the engine, and had served their watches in the
Maud. If there was any trouble, the chief engineer
was close at hand.</p>

<p>From eight to twelve it was the captain's watch.
Achang, who had been the master of a vessel, had
been regularly installed as second mate, and was in
charge of this watch; though Scott remained on deck
all the time, for he was anxious to observe the movements
of the Delhi. Clingman and Lane had their
two-hour tricks at the wheel, and there was no hard
work for anybody.</p>

<p>The breeze was good, though not heavy from the
south-west; but the Delhi had not yet set a sail. The
Blanchita passed Cape Datu at ten in the evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and the second mate made a note of it on the log-slate.
Both craft were still making their eight knots,
and remained abreast of each other. The wind increased
slightly in force, but the conditions were
about the same all night. At twelve the watch was
changed, and Morris came on duty, with Louis in the
engine-room. The captain turned in at this time.</p>

<p>At three in the morning the yacht was off the
island of Sirhassen, of which a note was made on
the log-slate. Morris had studied the chart enough
to enable him to recognize the island, distant as it
was, at six bells, or three o'clock in the morning. Of
course he could not identify it by its looks, never
having seen it before; but the captain had given him
the distances between the islands on the course. Sirhassen
was forty sea miles from Cape Datu, or five
hours as the yacht was running; and when land was
reported on the beam, bearing about west, he knew
what it was. The chart gave the island as one of
considerable size compared with the multitude of
small ones in that locality; and this indication afforded
him a further clew to the identification.</p>

<p>At eight bells, or four o'clock, the morning watch
came on duty, with Achang as its officer. Captain
Scott did not turn out when the second mate was
called, with Felix to take his place at the engine, and
it was six o'clock when he made his appearance.
Except when there is only one mate, as in small vessels,
the captain keeps no watch; but he is liable to
be called at any hour of the night in case of a squall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
or other peril. His responsibility may induce him to
spend the entire night on deck.</p>

<p>When he came out of the cabin, his first care
was to observe the signs which indicate the coming
weather. Then he went to the wheel, and read the
entries made on the log-slate. The sea was about
the same as it had been when he left the deck. He
had looked at the barometer before he left the cabin.
There were no signs of bad weather in any direction.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the weather, Mr. Achang?"
he asked of the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"It will be fine, Captain," replied the second
mate. "I have come all the way from Banjermassin
to Calcutta with the weather just like this always;
but I think we have more wind when the
sun come up."</p>

<p>"We can stand more than we have now," added
Scott.</p>

<p>"Some of the young gentlemen fear to go to sea
in open boat like this yacht; but the dhows and
the proas have not much decks," said the Bornean.</p>

<p>"Then you think we shall have weather like this
all the way to Point Cambodia?"</p>

<p>"May blow a little more hard some time."</p>

<p>The sun was coming up in the east, and in the
course of half an hour Achang's prophecy of more
wind was realized. It freshened rapidly for a short
time; but it did not come in flaws or squalls, and
was a steady breeze. A table had been set up in
the fore cabin; and at half-past seven, or seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
bells, which is the usual hour for breakfast at sea,
the meal was served to the watch below.</p>

<p>"Land on the port bow, sir!" reported Clingman,
who was the lookout man, just before eight
bells.</p>

<p>"That is Subi," said Achang, looking at the paper
Morris had given him when the watch was changed.</p>

<p>"That's right, Mr. Achang," added the captain.
"I see the Delhi is setting her foresail, and that
means wind enough to add something to her eight
knots an hour."</p>

<p>Lane at the wheel struck eight bells a few minutes
later; and the officer and engineer of the port watch
came promptly on deck from the cabin, as did the
seamen from the fore cabin. Breakfast had been
served at both ends of the yacht to the watch
below, so that they were in readiness to come on
duty at the striking of the bell. Breakfast was
ready for those who came off watch as soon as
they were relieved.</p>

<p>Pitts had his hands more than full in supplying
the two tables, but he was assisted by the idlers
about the boat. The seamen were served as on
board of the Guardian-Mother, where they had a
table and a regular meal. On ordinary sea-going
vessels the men get their "grub" at the galley in
tins, or kids, and eat it seated on the deck, or where
they choose.</p>

<p>Captain Scott had graciously ordained, as there
was nothing to be done outside of the working of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the yacht, that "watch and watch" should be the
rule on board; which means that the hands shall
have all their time to themselves when not on watch,
though they were to respond when all hands were
called.</p>

<p>"The Delhi means to run away from us, I suppose,
for she has put on all sail," said Louis as he
came on deck when he had finished his breakfast.</p>

<p>"But I don't believe she will do it," replied the
captain. "We have a sail; but I am waiting to
see what she can do under her present conditions,
and I have told Felipe to hurry her up a little,
just enough to keep up with our consort."</p>

<p>"She is gaining on us a little," added Louis.</p>

<p>"I see she is; but the engineer has thrown another
shovelful of coal into the furnace, and I wish
to see the effect it will produce. He has opened
his valve a little, but he has not steam enough
yet."</p>

<p>But it was soon evident to all who understood
the matter that the Blanchita was gaining on her
consort. It was plain, too, that Captain Rayburn
had noticed the fact, for his crew were setting the
gaff-topsails on the fore and main masts. Something
of the enthusiasm of a race was aroused on board.
Felipe had worked up his machine to the nine-knot
gauge; and in spite of the added sail on the Delhi,
the boat was overhauling her.</p>

<p>"I think that Captain Rayburn must be recalling
his talk to us at Sarawak about running away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
us," said Louis. "What is he doing now, Captain
Scott?"</p>

<p>"He appears to be hoisting a yard on his foremast,"
replied Scott.</p>

<p>"What is that for?"</p>

<p>"If you watch the steamer for a little while
longer, you will see him shake out a fore squaresail,
and that will be the sharpest move he has
made yet. Morris, have the mast stepped, and set
the sail," continued the captain.</p>

<p>Clinch was at the wheel; and Clingman was called
upon to do the work, with the assistance of the
other two hands. The great squaresail of the Delhi
had been shaken out, and it was drawing for all
it was worth. The effect was simply to prevent
the Blanchita from passing her, as she would have
done in a few minutes more. The enthusiasm of a
race was fully developed on board the yacht, among
the seamen as well as the cabin party. Clingman
and the others had worked very lively, and in a
few minutes the sail was set. The captain gave
the orders for trimming it; and as soon as the
sheet was made fast the yacht heeled over till her
rail was nearly down to the water.</p>

<p>"Our sail is a big one," said Scott, who saw it
spread out for the first time; "and if we desire to
run away from the Delhi, I am satisfied that we
could do it."</p>

<p>The boat dashed the spray at her bow, and proved
to be very wet in the fore cabin. The captain or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>dered
the curtains to be hauled down to keep the water
out, and the forward part of the craft was then as
dry as it had been on the river.</p>

<p>Scott was not quite satisfied with the steering
under the altered conditions, and he went to the
wheel himself. He was a very skilful boatman in
a sailing-craft, as had been fully proved by his bringing
his yacht, the Seahound, from New York through
the Bahama Islands. The seaman was inclined to
follow the compass too closely, while Scott regarded
the effect of the sail.</p>

<p>"We are gaining on the Delhi," said Louis, as he
seated himself near the captain.</p>

<p>"Of course we are; I knew she would do it with
the sail in this wind," replied Scott. "The Blanchita
is a light craft, and skims over the water like a
racer."</p>

<p>"But it is a little too much sail for her," suggested
Louis. "She is taking in a bucket of water
over her lee rail once in a while."</p>

<p>"Try the pump, Lane," added the captain. "I
don't believe she has shipped more than a teaspoonful
or two."</p>

<p>"We are pretty well down in the water," added
Louis.</p>

<p>"Clingman, let off about six inches of the sheet,"
continued Scott; and the order was promptly obeyed.
"I think you are getting a little nervous, my dear
fellow," he added to Louis.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am; I should not like to see the yacht<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
heel over and take in a couple of hogsheads of water,
for she is loaded so heavily with coal that she would
go to the bottom."</p>

<p>"But I should not let her ship such a sea as that.
The wind is quite steady, with no heavy flaws, and
the boat is under perfect control. I should like it
better to sail the Blanchita with less cargo in her,
but she is doing splendidly."</p>

<p>"But a flaw might come, even if we have had none
to-day; what could you do in that case?" asked
Louis.</p>

<p>"Clingman, stand by the sheet!" called the captain.</p>

<p>The seaman was seated on a box not more than
three feet from the cleat at which the sheet was
made fast. He took his place within reach of it.</p>

<p>"Now she heels over again!" exclaimed Louis, as
the water came quite up to the rail, though she took
none in.</p>

<p>"Cast off the sheet, Clingman!" called the captain;
and the order was obeyed in an instant.</p>

<p>The boat flew up to an even keel almost as though
she had been hoisted up by some giant power.</p>

<p>"That is how I should keep her from shipping a
big sea," said Scott, as he looked at his companion
with a smile on his brown face.</p>

<p>"I give it up, Captain Scott. Of course you know
what you are about every time, and I won't say a
word again about the boat. But suppose you were
not looking when the flaw came?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not necessary to be looking; for a skipper
steers more by the feeling of the boat than by sight.
Make fast the sheet, Clingman."</p>

<p>The Blanchita went ahead again; and by this time
she was abreast of the Delhi, and gaining upon her.
Captain Rayburn was on his quarter-deck.</p>

<p>"Don't run away from me, and I won't run away
from you!" he shouted.</p>

<p>But he had hardly spoken before a noise like the
distant report of a cannon was heard on board of the
yacht.</p>

<p>"He has split his fore squaresail; and if his game
was not up before, it is now," said Captain Scott.
"The sail was old and rotten, and I don't believe he
would have attempted to carry it except on an occasion
like the present."</p>

<p>"He was a little too pronounced when he expressed
his fears that the Blanchita would not be able to
keep up with him, and I fancy he is sorry he said
anything about it by this time," added Louis.</p>

<p>The split sail could not be repaired at once; and
if it could it was not strong enough to be of any use
in the fresh breeze. The crew took it in at once, the
yard being lowered to enable them to do so. The
captain of the yacht ordered the engineer to reduce
his speed to the ordinary rate, though the sail was
not furled. Between the steam and the wind the
Blanchita ran ahead of the Delhi. The sheet was
slacked off as far as it could be without permitting
the sail to shake, and the two craft kept well together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the rest of the day, passing Great Natuna Island at
four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The captain took the sun at noon, and worked up
the position of the boat. The run from the mouth of
the Sarawak at that time was two hundred and four
sea miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE END OF THE VOYAGE TO BANGKOK</h3>


<p>The routine of daily duty on board of the Blanchita
has been given; and after the race in the China
Sea had proved that she could run away from the
Delhi, there was no further excitement on the voyage.
On the contrary, it was rather monotonous, and there
were no incidents worthy of record. After passing
Great Natuna on the afternoon of the second day
from the mouth of the Sarawak, no land was seen
again till the island of Pulo Obi, about twenty miles
south-west of Point Cambodia, was seen on the third
day; and the Point on the mainland was passed a
little later.</p>

<p>At noon on this day the two vessels were forty-four
miles up the Gulf of Siam. The prophecies
of Captain Rayburn and Achang in regard to the
weather proved to be correct. The monsoon blew
steadily all the way, and the yacht carried her sail.
Not even a squall disturbed the serenity of the voyage,
and everything went on as during the first and
second days. The "Four" would have been glad to explore
the Great Natuna Island, and determine whether
or not it was inhabited; for they could obtain no information
in regard to it from any of the books they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
had brought from the ship, and they forgot to inquire
about it at Kuching.</p>

<p>At noon on the third day, in the Gulf, the captain
of the Delhi hailed the yacht, and came on board of
her.</p>

<p>"I shall have to bear more to the eastward now,
Captain Scott, and we shall soon part company," said
the commander of the Delhi. "We had quite a lively
race on our second day out, and you beat me handsomely.
I had no idea that your yacht could sail so
fast. I was afraid you could not keep up with me;
but I found that you could run away from me, as you
suggested before we sailed."</p>

<p>"I did not know myself what speed the Blanchita
could make, though I was informed that she
had gone nine knots for twelve hours together,"
replied Scott.</p>

<p>"I am very glad that I met you, and I hope I
shall see you again. You have a very agreeable
party, and I should think you might enjoy yourselves."</p>

<p>"I think we are likely to meet again at Saigon.
The Guardian-Mother will be there, and I hope you
will come on board of her," replied Captain Scott, as
they shook hands at parting, and the visitor returned
to the Delhi.</p>

<p>The Blanchita started her screw again; and the
captain gave out north-west as the course for the
mouth of the Menan River, on which Bangkok is situated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where do you expect to find the Guardian-Mother,
Captain Scott?" asked Louis.</p>

<p>"At Bangkok," replied the captain, as he took
his memorandum-book from his pocket. "Captain
Ringgold gave me his time for leaving there, and
also of sailing from Saigon."</p>

<p>"When was he to leave the capital of Siam?"</p>

<p>"On the first tide Monday morning. This is
Saturday, a little after noon," replied Scott. "We
have three hundred and twenty-five miles to make.
The monsoon is about as fresh here as it has been
all the voyage; and we have used up about half of
our coal, so that we are considerably lighter than
when we left Kuching, and with the sail we can
easily log nine knots an hour. We shall go into
the Menan River before sundown to-morrow, and it
will take two or three hours to go up to the city.
We shall be alongside the ship some time in the
evening; and that is just the time I should like to
be there."</p>

<p>"We shall give our friends a tremendous surprise,"
added Louis.</p>

<p>"That is so; for while your anxious mamma is
worrying for fear you have been chewed up by an
orang-outang, and Flix's grandma is dreaming that
he has been swallowed whole by a big boa-constrictor,
we shall drop in on them while they are singing
gospel hymns in the music-room."</p>

<p>"I shall be sorry to disappoint grandma; but if
she insists upon dreaming such nonsense, it is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
my fault," added Felix. "She ought to know by
this time that snakes don't swallow me till they get
a bullet through their heads."</p>

<p>"I don't think my mother has been greatly worried
about me, for she has learned that I am able to
take care of myself," said Louis.</p>

<p>"But the mothers will hug their boys as soon as
they get hold of them."</p>

<p>"I wish the hugging might be confined to the
mothers, for it is perfectly proper for them to do
that thing; but when it comes to a grandma who
hasn't a drop of Irish blood in her veins, I beg to
be excused, and, what is more, I won't stand it,"
protested Felix, making a very comical face.</p>

<p>"But you can't help yourself, Flix," laughed the
captain.</p>

<p>"You see if I don't!" replied the Milesian, shaking
his head as though his plan to avoid the endearing
reception had already been formed.</p>

<p>"We shall see what we shall see," added the
captain. "It seems to me that the breeze is stronger
here than it was out at sea."</p>

<p>"There is a hot country to the east of us, and
perhaps the wind is hurrying up to fill a partial
vacuum there," suggested Louis.</p>

<p>"You are a philosopher, my darling Louis, and
that must be the reason," added Felix.</p>

<p>The Blanchita seemed to be flying through the
water, for her speed had sensibly increased since
she came into the Gulf. There were several large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
islands along the coast of Cambodia; but the course
was fifty miles outside of the mainland, which could
not be seen.</p>

<p>"Why do you keep so far from the shore, Captain
Scott?" asked Louis; for all the party would have
been glad to observe the shore.</p>

<p>"Because we all wish to get to Bangkok to-morrow
evening. What is the shortest way between two
points, Louis?"</p>

<p>"A straight line, of course."</p>

<p>"That's the reason we keep her so far from the
land. A north-west course from a point outside of
Obi Island to Cape Liant takes the yacht on the
course we are running now."</p>

<p>"That explains it all," replied Louis.</p>

<p>The watches were regularly kept, and the captain
was satisfied that the Blanchita was making over
nine knots an hour. There was no excitement of
any kind on board, and the rest of the day was without
anything worthy of note. The Delhi had gone
in behind an island, and in a few hours she was no
longer to be seen. And so it was all day Sunday.
Cape Liant was passed about one o'clock. A river
pilot was taken about five o'clock. He could not
speak English, but Achang spoke to him in Malay.</p>

<p>"Ask him if the Guardian-Mother is in the river,
Achang," said the captain.</p>

<p>The pilot could not make out the name, and the
interpreter described the ship so that he understood
him at last. The face of the Siamese lighted up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
when he got the idea, and it was seen by the four
that the ship was there. Achang informed them
that the Guardian-Mother was anchored in the river.</p>

<p>The river was full of boats, and on many of them
houses were built. The people were new to the
Americans, though they were not very different to
the ordinary observer from the Burmese and other
natives they had seen. Before the yacht was half-way
up to the city, it was too dark to see anything
distinctly, and the party were more interested in the
expected surprise of their friends on board the ship
than anything else.</p>

<p>When the yacht was within a short distance of
the ship, the pilot pointed her out. The singing
in the music-room could be distinctly heard, and
everything was working precisely as Scott had said
it would. At the gangway the barge of the Blanche
was made fast; and it was evident that General
Noury and his wife were on board, and perhaps
Captain Sharp and his lady. The boat was worked
very carefully and noiselessly up to the platform of
the gangway, where several sailors were seated.</p>

<p>"The Blanchita!" exclaimed Quartermaster Bangs,
as he recognized the craft. "Captain Scott! I will
inform the captain that you are alongside."</p>

<p>"Don't do anything of the kind, Bangs!" replied
Scott. "Don't say a word, and don't make any
noise, any of you. We want to drop in on the party
without any notice."</p>

<p>The quartermaster was a very intelligent fellow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and he took in the situation at a glance. The "Big
Four" stepped lightly on the platform, and Felix
had taken pains to be the last one to mount the
gangway. Scott led the way, and halted at the door
of the music-room. He waited there till the hymn
they were singing was finished, and then threw open
the door, and marched in. He took off his cap, and
bowed as gracefully as a dancing-master to the
assembly.</p>

<p>Louis and Morris followed him, and imitated the
example he had given them; but Felix had disappeared,
and they did not know what had become
of him. The musical party seemed to be so utterly
confounded at the sudden and unexpected appearance
of the hunters from Borneo that they seemed
to be struck dumb with amazement.</p>

<p>"Louis, my son!" Mrs. Belgrave screamed as she
rushed upon her boy, and folded him in her arms,
kissing him as though he had come back to her from
a tomb or a grave beneath the ocean.</p>

<p>"Morris!" cried Mrs. Woolridge, as she imitated
the example of Mrs. Belgrave.</p>

<p>"My brother!" exclaimed Miss Blanche, as she
divided the neck and arms of the returned hunter
with her mother.</p>

<p>"This is somewhat unexpected, Captain Scott,"
said Captain Ringgold, as he came forward, and took
the hand of the captain of the Blanchita, who alone
of the trio was not in the arms of a mother.</p>

<p>"I should say that it might be, Captain," replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Scott as coolly as though the meeting was nothing
unusual.</p>

<p>"But how under the sun did you get here, Scott?"
demanded the commander, scrutinizing the expression
of the third officer,&mdash;which was his rank on
board of the ship,&mdash;to ascertain if there were any
signs of a calamity there.</p>

<p>"We came by water, Captain," answered the young
officer, with a cheerful smile, which indicated anything
but a disaster.</p>

<p>"Of course you did, inasmuch as there is no other
way to get here. In what steamer did you come?
for I believe there is no regular line from Sarawak
to Bangkok," added Captain Ringgold.</p>

<p>"We came by the steamer Blanchita."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it at all," said the commander
with a perplexed look on his face. "Do you mean
that you made the voyage in the steam-yacht, Mr.
Scott?" and there was a decided expression of incredulity
on his face.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I mean to assert; and if
you have any doubts about the truth of what I say,
I appeal to Louis and Morris to substantiate my
assertion."</p>

<p>"If you really say so, I do not doubt the truth
of what you declare. It looks like a foolhardy
risk, but boys will be boys. I will not detain you
now; for others wish to welcome you back, and I
know they are all glad to see you, unexpected as
your return is."</p>

<p>As soon as his mother released him from the
bondage of her loving arms, Louis hastened to Miss
Blanche, and she grasped his hand as he approached.
No loving expressions passed between them, but
what they might have said that could be classed
under this head was seen on their telltale faces.</p>

<p>"But where is Felix?" demanded Mrs. Blossom,
who had been looking for him since Scott came into
the room. "Where is he, Mr. Scott?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that he was swallowed by a
big boa-constrictor one hundred and sixty feet long,
and twelve feet in circumference," replied the captain
of the Blanchita, as seriously as though there
had been such a monster snake in existence.</p>

<p>The poor lady was impervious to a joke; she
screamed once, and then dropped in a sitting posture
on a divan. Nearly all the rest of the party laughed
heartily. At this point the head of Felix dropped
down a foot through the skylight over the centre
of the room. He had made his way to the upper
deck, and stationed himself where he could see and
hear all that passed in the apartment.</p>

<p>"Good-mahrnin' to ye's all this foine avenin'!" he
shouted. "Don't ye's make a row, Aunty. The
schnake was a bit troubled wid indigestion of the
brain, and, faix! I was too much for him! Loike
the sodjers surrounded by the inimy, Oi cut me way
out, and here Oi am."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you were swallowed by a snake,"
protested Mrs. Blossom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you believe that Jonah swallowed the
whale, Aunty?" demanded Felix.</p>

<p>"Of course I believe that because it is in the Bible.
If you had told me that you had swallowed the
snake, I might have believed that," added the good
lady.</p>

<p>At this point General Noury came forward, and
grasped the hand of Scott, passing from him to Louis
and Morris, and then doing the same with Felix, who
had dropped down from his perch at the skylight.
As soon as Mrs. Blossom saw him on the floor, she
rushed towards him with outspread arms; but the
Milesian warded off the assault, and took her right
hand.</p>

<p>"Don't hug me, Aunty, for the snake swallowed
me clothes and all, and you may get some of the
poison on you," said he.</p>

<p>For some time longer there was a general handshaking,
and Louis was kissed by the Princess Zuleima.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>LOUIS'S DOUBLE-DINNER ARGUMENT</h3>


<p>After the welcome of the Bornean hunters had
spent itself in kissing and handshaking, the question
came up as to why the "Big Four" had abandoned
their explorations after one week in the island instead
of three, the time arranged for them to remain
there; and they had fixed the time themselves.</p>

<p>"I thought three weeks was a rather long time for
you to be in the island," said Captain Ringgold after
the question had been opened for discussion.</p>

<p>"We fixed the time before we knew anything
about the island," replied Louis. "But I want to
say, in order to counteract the impression which appears
to prevail in this company, that our trip was
not a failure; for we had a fine time, and enjoyed our
trips on the rivers."</p>

<p>"If you had a good time, why did you cut it short
by two-thirds of the period allotted to the excursions?"
asked Uncle Moses.</p>

<p>"We went up the Sarawak, the Sadong, and the
Simujan, up the last to the mountains, passing through
Lake Padang, and we have shot an orang-outang, and
might have killed more of them, to say nothing of
other game," replied Louis, whom Scott had requested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to do the talking. "We visited three Dyak villages,
sailed the Blanchita through a forest, and killed a
good many crocodiles."</p>

<p>"You seem to have had sport enough," added
Uncle Moses. "Why did you give it up in the
cream of the thing?"</p>

<p>"I believe you like a good dinner, Uncle Moses;
such a dinner as you always have on board of the
Guardian-Mother," continued Louis, who was evidently
pluming himself to make a point.</p>

<p>"I do like a good dinner, and enjoy one very
much," replied the worthy trustee of the young millionaire.
"But I doubt if I am any more devoted to
such a banquet as we get every day than my beloved
friend, Brother Adipose Tissue, and all the rest of
the voyagers all over the world."</p>

<p>"I plead guilty to the charge of Brother Avoirdupois;
and I acknowledge myself to be a worshipper
at the shrine of Mr. Melancthon Sage, and I invoke
a blessing upon the head of Monsieur Odervie, the
chief cook. Our life on the ocean wave is a constant
promotive of the appetite. If the proof of the pudding
is not in the eating of the bag, it is in the eating
of the dinners; and I think we pay an abundant tribute
to the talent of Mr. Sage, the prince of stewards,
in the quantity of the well-cooked food he causes to
be placed before us."</p>

<p>"We get through dinner about seven o'clock. I
see that the accomplished chief steward is standing
at the door," continued Louis. "Now, Mr. Sage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
would it be possible and convenient for you to have
another dinner on the table, say at eight o'clock, an
hour after the first feast had been finished?"</p>

<p>"Quite possible, and even convenient; the only persons
to complain of such an arrangement would be
the cooks and stewards," replied Mr. Sage.</p>

<p>"Captain Ringgold, might I so far presume upon
any influence I may have with you as the owner of
the Guardian-Mother to request you to order a second
dinner to be served at eight in the evening, beginning,
say, with to-morrow evening?" asked the
young millionaire, looking as serious as though he
was about to preach a sermon, though the party
were generally laughing.</p>

<p>"As I have always told you, I take my orders
from the owner; and if you desire such a dinner,
I shall certainly give Mr. Sage an order to that
effect," replied the commander.</p>

<p>"But who is to eat the dinner after it is provided,
an hour after the passengers have gorged themselves
at the table?" demanded Dr. Hawkes. "Is this a
conspiracy to make more work for the surgeon?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," protested Louis. "It is to give the
gentlemen who question so closely an opportunity to
have an abundance of a good thing."</p>

<p>"But we could not eat the dinner," said Uncle
Moses. "We are not hogs."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are not!" chuckled the owner.</p>

<p>"But what has all this to do with hunting and
exploring in Borneo?" inquired Mr. Woolridge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, after we had taken a full dinner in
Borneo, Uncle Moses and the commander ask us
why we did not eat another dinner immediately on
the top of it, as I observe that they are not disposed
to do on board of the ship," returned Louis.</p>

<p>Some of the party had penetrated to the conclusion
of Louis's argument, but most of them did not see
the point of his illustration till he made his last
remark; then Mr. Woolridge began to clap his hands,
and the whole company applauded vigorously.</p>

<p>"I suppose the interpretation of the whole matter
is, that the hunters in Borneo were gorged with hunting,"
said Captain Ringgold; "and that when they
stipulated for three weeks of the sport, they overdid
the matter."</p>

<p>"That was precisely the situation, Mr. Commander;
and if you had been with us on the waters of Padang
Lake, you could not have defined it better," replied
Louis.</p>

<p>"But it is almost incredible that a quartet of such
Nimrods should have become disgusted with their
favorite sport in a single week," added Captain
Ringgold.</p>

<p>"We are not hogs, as Uncle Moses gently suggested,
and we could not eat a second dinner on top
of the first so soon. If we had gone to Borneo a
second time, after a reasonable interval, I am confident
we should have enjoyed a second week of hunting,
even along the muddy rivers and inundated
jungles," Louis explained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"In other words, you bit off a bigger mouthful
than you could swallow," said the commander with
a hearty laugh; for he had predicted that three weeks
of hunting at one time was too much. "But we understand
the situation now up to the time of the departure
of the Nimrods from their happy hunting-ground.
It was a rather daring enterprise to make a voyage of
nine hundred miles in an open boat; and I should
like to ask who was the originator of the idea."</p>

<p>"If there is any blame for this trip, we were all
in the same boat, and we share the responsibility,"
answered Louis. "Captain Achang Bakir was with
us; and he has sailed in all the seas of the Archipelago
in an open boat, and we had his advice.
Then we sailed all the way to the entrance of the
Gulf of Siam in company with the steamer Delhi,
whose captain agreed to stand by us, and to supply
us with coal if we came short."</p>

<p>"That puts a new face on the matter."</p>

<p>"It was in the head waters of the Simujan that
the plan was discussed, and Captain Scott was the
originator of the idea," continued Louis. "I was in
favor of it first because it would save the Guardian-Mother
the voyage from Saigon back to Kuching,
about a thousand miles."</p>

<p>"Where is Kuching?" asked Dr. Hawkes.</p>

<p>"It is the native name for Sarawak."</p>

<p>"I am heartily glad you have come to us, Louis,
for the reason you have given," added the commander.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did the steam-yacht work, Mr. Belgrave?"
asked the rajah.</p>

<p>"Exceedingly well, sir; nothing could have done
any better; but Mr. Scott can answer you better
than I can, sir."</p>

<p>The third officer of the ship, late captain of the
Blanchita, described the working of the yacht, and
gave her liberal praise. He related in what manner
she had beaten the Delhi in the race, and that he had
carried sail all the way nearly from the start. He
gave the party the routine of the boat,&mdash;how they had
taken their meals, and how they had slept on board.</p>

<p>"But I think it is time for us to return to the
Blanche," interposed Captain Sharp, as the clock
struck eleven.</p>

<p>"I must make an announcement before you go,"
said Captain Ringgold. "We shall not be able to
sail for Saigon to-morrow morning, as arranged before.
We have to clean the Blanchita in the morning,
and she has to be put on the upper deck of the
Blanche. As the Nimrods have come to Bangkok, I
wish to give them a day on shore to see the temples,
and call on the king if they are so disposed. We
will sail on Tuesday morning on the early tide."</p>

<p>"But we have not had any account of the adventures
of the Nimrods in Borneo," suggested Uncle
Moses.</p>

<p>"We shall do so at eight o'clock in the morning;
and you will all assemble for the purpose at that
time. The lecture on Siam and Cambodia has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
postponed till all hands could hear it; and if General
Noury is ready, that shall follow the adventures,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>"I will be here at the time stated, for we all desire
to know what the Nimrods have been doing," replied
the general, as the party from the Blanche retired
from the music-room.</p>

<p>The rest of the company went to their staterooms,
while the commander gave his orders for the work
of the morning. All hands were called at daylight;
and the young adventurers shook hands with the officers
they found on deck, and spoke a pleasant word
to the seamen on duty. The latter were hoisting the
coal, provisions, and stores of the Blanchita on board
of the ship; and by breakfast-time the yacht was as
clean as a Dutch chamber.</p>

<p>At the appointed time the company, including the
party from the Blanche, were seated in the arm-chairs
of Conference Hall; and Louis went through
his narrative of the adventures of the Nimrods in
Borneo. During the morning, Achang had placed
the stuffed orang-outang on a shelf the carpenter had
erected at the head of the platform, with the proboscis
monkey on one side, and the argus-pheasant on
the other. The Bornean had had some experience as
a taxidermist, and Dr. Hawkes declared that he had
done his work well.</p>

<p>Louis explained these specimens, and gave the
measurements of the orang. The proboscis monkey
and the bird were also described. When he said he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
had not been disposed to shoot monkeys and other
harmless animals for the fun of it, the audience applauded.
He had killed a specimen of several animals,
and several pigs, deer, and one bear, most of
the latter for food. The cook had packed the last of
the fish in the ice, so that it had kept well, and it
had been served for breakfast that morning. Everybody
had praised it. The surgeon called it the gourami,
and said that some successful attempts had
been made to introduce the fish in American waters.</p>

<p>The audience laughed heartily when Louis related
in what manner they had killed and sold one hundred
and eight feet of crocodile for about forty dollars.
He told what he had learned about the Dyaks, and described
the long-house they had visited, and the head-house,
and gave the story in full of Rajah Brooke,
and their visits to his nephew and successor, the present
rajah. He might have gone on with his narrative
till lunch-time if he had not known that General
Noury was waiting for him to finish his account.</p>

<p>"Did you see the Dyak women, Louis?" asked
his mother.</p>

<p>"Plenty of them. The older ones reminded me of
the French women; for when they begin to grow old,
they wrinkle and dry up. The morality of the Dyaks
is much higher in tone, even among the laboring-classes,
men and women, than in civilized countries.
They are all honest; and they steal nothing, even in
Kuching, though the Malays and Chinamen do it for
them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were the young women pretty, Mr. Belgrave?"
inquired Mrs. Woolridge.</p>

<p>"To a Dyak gentleman I suppose they are; but I
was not fascinated with them, though I saw some on
the Simujan who were not bad looking. The prettiest
one I saw was at a village near the mountains.
But the general is waiting for me to finish, and I
must answer no more questions at present," replied
the speaker, as he bowed, and hastened from the rostrum.</p>

<p>Then it was found that Mr. Gaskette had not hung
up the map of Cochin China, for Achang and the carpenter
had taken up the space before appropriated to
it. Mr. Stevens, the carpenter, suggested a way to
get over the difficulty; but it would take him half
an hour to put up a frame in front of the orang.</p>

<p>"I shall not be able to get half through Cochin
China before lunch-time," said General Noury, consulting
his watch.</p>

<p>"I am afraid your audience will be scatterbrained,
General, there is so much going on about the decks.
Perhaps we had better postpone the lecture till after
we have sailed to-morrow morning, especially as the
Nimrods will be on shore this afternoon," suggested
the commander.</p>

<p>"I approve the suggestion; let it be adopted."</p>

<p>The Blanche party lunched on board, and spent the
afternoon there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>A HASTY GLANCE AT BANGKOK</h3>


<p>While the carpenter and the second officer were
busy making a place for the large map of Cochin
China, the returned hunters from Borneo were invited
to the cabin of the commander. They were pleased
with the change of scene from the mud and water
of their week in Borneo; though they felt that they
would like to go there for another week&mdash;not more
than that&mdash;at another time.</p>

<p>"After lunch you will visit the city of Bangkok,
and spend the afternoon there; for you ought to see
the place, as you are here," said Captain Ringgold.
"It is a large city."</p>

<p>"How large is it, Captain?" asked Louis.</p>

<p>"That is more than anybody in Siam, or anywhere
else, can tell you. In these Oriental countries, when
they count the people, they do not include the females
in the enumeration, so that we get but half an idea
of the whole number. Chambers puts it at 300,000;
the 'Year Book' does not give it at all; Bradshaw
puts it down at 500,000; Lippincott the same.
Probably the larger number is the nearer correct,
and the authorities quoted are issued the present
year."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see no end of Chinamen flitting about the river,"
said Scott.</p>

<p>"They compose about one-half of the population of
the city; and most of the trade of the place is in their
hands, as you have found it to be, though to a less
degree, in other cities you have visited in the East.
The Celestials are taxed three dollars when they
come into Siam, and pay the same amount every three
years. But there is the lunch-bell. If you have
no objection, Professor Giroud will go on shore with
you."</p>

<p>"I should be delighted to have his company," replied
Louis; and the others said the same thing.</p>

<p>The conversation at the table related more to Borneo
than to anything else, and the Nimrods had all
the questions they could answer put to them; and
some of the ladies wished they had remained there a
few days.</p>

<p>"If I had supposed the Nimrods would stay there
only a week, I should have been quite willing to remain
at Sarawak that time," added the commander.</p>

<p>"We fixed the time at three weeks because we
thought it would take you all of that time to see
Siam and Cambodia, and get back to Sarawak," replied
Scott.</p>

<p>"I think it would have been delightful to sail on
those rivers, and see the uncivilized people of the
island," added Mrs. Belgrave. "But I suppose we
should have been in the way of the hunters."</p>

<p>"Not at all, madam," answered Scott. "We had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a sampan, in which we could have done our hunting,
while you were examining the long-houses and the
head-houses. I don't know but that we should have
wished to remain the whole three weeks if the ladies
had been with us."</p>

<p>"Gallant Captain Scott!" exclaimed the lady.</p>

<p>"We did not go up the Rajang River as we intended,
and we should have done that if you had been
with us. I am very sure the Dyak ladies would have
been delighted to see you, more than you would have
been to see them," replied Scott.</p>

<p>"The steam-yacht must have been very delightful
on the rivers and lakes; but the crocodiles, the
snakes, and the savage orang-outangs would not
have been pleasant to us."</p>

<p>"But with eleven Winchester repeating-rifles ready
for use, you would have had nothing to fear."</p>

<p>Captain Ringgold rose from the table; and this
terminated the conversation, and the party went
on deck.</p>

<p>"Captain Ringgold said you had offered to go
on shore with us, Professor Giroud," said Louis, as
he joined the instructor. "We shall be delighted
with your company."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Belgrave. I have been on shore
every day, with or without the party, and have
learned something about Bangkok. I may be of
service to you," replied the professor.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will," said Scott.</p>

<p>The first cutter was in the water when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
reached the gangway, with the crew in their places.
They went on board, and the bowman shoved off.
Stoody, the coxswain, gave the orders, and the boat
was immediately under way. She was steered towards
the shore till she came abreast of the various
craft moored there, and then headed up the river.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Stoody?" asked Scott.</p>

<p>"Captain Ringgold told me to take the party
up the river, to show them the boats and houses,"
replied the coxswain.</p>

<p>"That is a good idea, Mr. Scott," added the professor.</p>

<p>"The houses here are all afloat," said Morris.
"They are three or four deep."</p>

<p>"Everybody is not allowed to build his house
on shore; for that is a royal privilege, doled out to
a few of the highest nobility," said the professor.
"I suppose there is not room enough in the city
for much besides the palaces and the temples, but
beyond its limits we shall find plenty of land-houses."</p>

<p>"But I should think these floating houses would
be smashed to pieces in a heavy blow; and I see
there are plenty of steamers and tugboats in the
river, which might bump against them," Morris
objected.</p>

<p>"You see that the middle of the river is kept
open, though it is very crooked; and these things
regulate themselves."</p>

<p>"These houses are no better than card-boxes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
They seem to be built of bamboos, with wicker-work
and plants. Each of them has a veranda
in front, which is a nice place to sit and read,
with a kind of ell at each end. I think I should
like to live in one of them for a week or two,"
continued Morris.</p>

<p>"You would not like it," said Achang, who had
come with them to act as interpreter.</p>

<p>"This is a walled town, with six miles of fortifications
around it."</p>

<p>"A little less than two miles across it; and we
shall not have to take any very long walks, for I
have read that carriages are seldom seen except
among the palaces, and probably belong to the
nobility," said Louis; "but we are good for six
miles this afternoon."</p>

<p>"The river is the great thoroughfare for business
and for pleasure. It is covered with boats
of all sorts and kinds. The walls of the city are
from fifteen to thirty feet high, and twelve feet
thick; but I suppose the heavy guns of modern
times could knock them down in a very short
time," added the professor.</p>

<p>"What is that opening into the river?" asked
Felix, who had kept his tongue very quiet so far.</p>

<p>"That is a canal," replied Achang, as the professor
did not reply. "I have been here three
times, and once I went up that canal. There are
only a few good streets in the city, and inside
business is carried on by the canals."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"As Paris is to France, and Paris is France, so
Bangkok is Siam; and that is the reason why the
commander goes no farther. Now we have come
to the wall, and you can see the outside town."</p>

<p>"The houses here are all on stilts, as in Sumatra
and Borneo," observed Scott. "Some of them are
built over the water."</p>

<p>"It is said here that the city suffered terribly
from the ravages of cholera; and when the king
found out that the disease was caused by the bad
drainage of the houses, he ordered his people to
build on the river, where the drainage would dispose
of itself," said Professor Giroud. "This story
was told me by a Frenchman here, but I cannot
vouch for the truth of the statement."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, Achang, why they build their
houses on piles in this country?" asked Morris.</p>

<p>"Because they have waterations here."</p>

<p>"Have what?" demanded the questioner, while
all the party laughed except the Bornean. "I never
heard of waterations before."</p>

<p>"When the water rise up high," Achang explained.</p>

<p>"Inundations, you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes; thunderations," added Achang.</p>

<p>"Inundations!" roared the Bornean's preceptor.</p>

<p>"That's what I say; and that's the first reason.
The second is that there are many snakes"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then, it's the place for me!" exclaimed Felix.</p>

<p>"Many snakes and wild beasts; the stilts help to
keep them out of the house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"But most snakes can climb trees," Scott objected.</p>

<p>"Fixed so that snake can't get off the post into
house," the Bornean explained.</p>

<p>"The little corn-houses in New England and other
places are protected in the same way from rats.
Four posts are set up for it to rest on, with a flat
stone, or sometimes a large tin pan turned upside
down, placed on the post. When the building is
erected with the corners on the large, flat stone or
the pans, rats or other rodents cannot get over these
obstructions, and the corn is safe from them," continued
Louis, illustrating his subject with a pencil for
the post, and his hand for the stone or the pan.</p>

<p>Scott, who was an officer of the ship, ordered
Stoody to take the party to the landing nearest to
the Temple of Wat Chang, as the professor requested.</p>

<p>"The religion of Siam, like that of Burma, is
Buddhist, in whose honor most of the temples whose
spires you can see are erected," said the professor, as
he pointed to several of them.</p>

<p>"We don't care to see them in detail, even if we
had the time," suggested Louis. "I know they are
magnificent pieces of architecture, and wonderful to
behold; but we have had about enough of that sort
of thing."</p>

<p>The party landed, and walked to the temple. It
looked like an exaggerated bell, the spire being the
handle, and the lower portion looking like an enormous
flight of circular stairs for the roof. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
over two hundred feet high. Attached to it in the
rear was a structure with a pitched roof. They
bought photographs of it at the stand of a native
who spoke a little French. At this point Achang procured
a guide who spoke French, and he conducted
them to the Temple of the Sleeping Idol.</p>

<p>"It is not much of a temple compared with the
one we have just visited," said the professor. "We
must go into it."</p>

<p>They entered, conducted by the guide. The building
looked like three pitched-roof structures set
together, the middle one into the largest at the
bottom, and the smallest into the middle one. It
contains an enormous figure of Buddha, one hundred
and sixty feet long, which about fills the interior of
the temple. It is constructed of brick, plastered and
then gilded, so that it looks like a golden statue in
a reclining posture. The feet are sixteen feet long,
and the arms six feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The party looked in at another temple, which contains
a brass statue of Buddha fifty feet high, with
other smaller statues, and a variety of objects that
were unintelligible to the visitors. Various other temples
were examined hastily on the way to the royal
palace, but they were only a repetition of what they
had often seen before.</p>

<p>The palace was a magnificent building, or series
of buildings, for a half-civilized country. The tourists
were permitted to enter at the gate, though the
guide was excluded. They saw a squad of the royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
guards who were drilling on the pavement, and they
regarded them with great interest. They wore a
Zouave uniform, though with a short frock-coat buttoned
to the chin, with round caps in cylindrical form,
and visors. They were armed with muskets, and
commanded by native officers.</p>

<p>"This palace is a big thing," said the professor,
"and is a mile in circumference, surrounded by
walls."</p>

<p>It contained, besides the palace of the king, the
public offices, temples, a theatre, barracks for several
thousand soldiers, and apartments for three thousand
women, six hundred of whom are the wives of the
king. But what interested them more than most of
the sights was the famous white elephant. He is said
to be of equal rank with the king, and is treated with
all possible deference and respect. He has a palatial
stable; and being a king, he lives like one. His servants
and attendants are all priests. But he is not
a pleasant sprig of royalty, and the visitors were
warned not to go too near him.</p>

<p>But it was time to return to the ship, and they
found the boat in the canal which Achang had indicated.
At dinner the conversation was concerning
the city, and the party mentioned many things the
Nimrods had not seen. On Tuesday morning the
ship sailed on her voyage to Saigon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A VIEW OF COCHIN CHINA AND SIAM</h3>


<p>The ship sailed at six o'clock in the morning, but
nearly all the passengers were on deck as soon as
the screw began to turn. They were still in the
Torrid Zone; and they saw the sun rise, though the
days had become a trifle longer. The Menam River
is the great thoroughfare of Bangkok, and the floating
houses lined the river three or four deep for a
considerable distance below the city. The party
found plenty of objects to engage their attention as
the steamer slowly made her way towards the Gulf.
Breakfast was served at the usual hour; and as soon
as the pilot was discharged, the company gathered at
Conference Hall for the lecture.</p>

<p>The siamangs and the baby were still great favorites
with all on board; and Mr. Mingo, Mrs. Mingo,
and Miss Mingo, as they had been named, had made
great progress in civilization. All of them were
regular attendants at the meetings in Conference
Hall, and always behaved themselves with the greatest
propriety. The mother usually occupied one of
the arm-chairs, while the baby was held in the lap
of one of the ladies. They looked at the speaker
just as though they understood what he was saying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
They joined in the applause when the lecturer presented
himself before his audience with their "Ra,
ra, ra!" finishing with the squeak which was a
part of their language.</p>

<p>General Noury took his place on the platform after
he had shaken hands with Mrs. Mingo, who gave
him an encouraging smile as he mounted the rostrum.
The Sumatra lady looked at him very earnestly,
and Miss Blanche declared that she understood
everything that was going on. Mrs. Noury, the
Princess Zuleima, had the baby; and the little siamang
seemed to take as much interest in the proceedings
as her mother. Mr. Mingo was not literary, and
perched in the fore-rigging.</p>

<p>The great map seemed to have been drawn and
colored with even unusual care, perhaps because Mr.
Gaskette had had more time to attend to it. It
was displayed on the new frame which the carpenter
had built for it, and included the entire peninsula
east of the Burmese possessions, and south of China
and the Shan States. When the applause which
greeted the general had subsided, he directed the
pointer at the map.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some of you will be considerably confused
by the various names of the territory we are engaged
in visiting at the present time," he began; and Mrs.
Mingo gave a louder squeak than usual as a special
greeting to the distinguished gentleman. "Cochin
China, I think, is the most common name, though
Indo-China is very generally used. It is also called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Farther India and Annam. Its various divisions are
the Shan States, tributary to Siam, taking their name
from a race of people who are of the same descent
as the natives of China. You observe that there are
more of these states in the territory of Burma, to
which they are subject. These states tributary to
Siam contain a population of about two millions.</p>

<p>"Next south comes Siam proper. Lying east of
the Shan States and Siam is a territory called the
Little Lao States, which are subject to the several
countries around them. On the east, bordering on
the China Sea, is Annam, a part of which is sometimes
labelled Cochin China. A part of Annam is
Tonquin, in the north, next to China. What is
called Cambodia, next south of Siam, and appearing
to be a part of it, is an indefinite factor of Cochin
China, and may properly enough be counted in with
Siam. What is called Independent Cambodia, if it
is independent, is a triangular country south-east of
Siam. French Cochin China occupies the most southern
portion of the peninsula.</p>

<p>"Nearly the whole of the territory of Cochin
China is under the protection of France; and in my
judgment, which you can accept for what it is worth,
the whole peninsula will eventually become French,
under whatever form it may be accomplished. Very
recently the relations between France and Siam were
very much strained over a disputed boundary question.
France had ships of war at the mouth of the
Menam, and sent some of the smaller craft up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
river. It looked very much like war; but before the
ships bombarded Bangkok, Siam yielded, and gave
up the portion of territory claimed; and no doubt
it will be the same story told over again from time
to time, until Siam exists only as a dependency of
France.</p>

<p>"Though you see mountains laid down on Mr.
Gaskette's map, the elevations hardly deserve that
name; for nearly the whole of Cochin China is low
ground, almost flat. The Mekhong River is the largest
in the peninsula, being 2,800 miles long. It
rises in Thibet, and is navigable only in its lower
waters. On account of the low level of the country
there are many canals, or bayous as you call them in
Louisiana, which connect many of the rivers. Let
us now return to Siam. By the way, I find the latest
map I have seen of this region in Chambers's, published
last year; and it is quite different from the
one before you."</p>

<p>"But not from the one that will be before you in
half a minute more," interposed Mr. Gaskette, as he
unrolled and hung up a smaller one which he had
just completed. "I made this one this morning,
after the commander had shown me the one to which
you allude; and you can see that it is a very crude
one."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mr. Gaskette, for the new map;
and though you took it from a book not more than
a year old, I am afraid that it is not entirely correct
for to-day. You observe, my friends, that Siam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
occupies nearly the whole of the peninsula east of
Burma. Annam is cut down to a very thin slice on
the China Sea; and Tonquin, where France has kept
many soldiers employed for several years, is swelled
into a considerable territory. I doubt if the last
change in the boundary of Siam is shown before you.
The limits of Cambodia are closely defined.</p>

<p>"Nearly the whole of the peninsula was included
in the ancient kingdom of Cambodia, existing at
the Christian era; and Buddhism is believed to have
been introduced into it in the fourth century. Some
remarkable ruins, with interesting sculptures, have
been found as testimonials to the greatness of this
ancient country. The Temple of Angkor had 1,532
columns, and the stone for the structure was brought
from a quarry thirty-two miles distant. Massive
bridges, so solidly built that they have resisted the
ravages of time and the inundations of more than
a thousand years, are still to be seen. One of them
is four hundred and seventy feet long, and has
thirty-four arches. An account of these wonders
was given by a Chinese traveller of the thirteenth
century, and they seem to bear some comparison
with the works of the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>"The native name of Siam is <i>Muang Th&aacute;i</i>, which
you will please to remember; and I mention it only
to tell you that it means 'The Land of the Free,'
and it must be a first cousin of your country, Mr.
Commander; but I suppose you will not accept the
relationship because 'The Home of the Brave' is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
not included. Siam has an area of about 250,000
square miles, as estimated by geographers; and one
authority gives it a population of 6,000,000, and
another 8,000,000, but they agree in giving it 2,000,000
Siamese, and 1,000,000 Chinese. The rest of
the number is made up with Malays, Laosians, and
other tribes.</p>

<p>"The Menam River is six hundred miles long, and
it has several branches. On the banks of these
streams very nearly all the people live, for the
regions away from them are a wild jungle which is
not cultivated. The country is healthy enough for
a tropical region, though malarial fevers are very
trying to European residents and visitors. The wet
season is from May to November, when it rains
about every day; and the rest of the year it does not
rain at all. The average rainfall is fifty-four inches
a year, and the average temperature 81&deg;, though the
glass goes up to 94&deg; in April; but New York beats
that in summer.</p>

<p>"Agriculture stands at a low ebb; but the abundant
rains and the rich soil produce very large
harvests of rice, the principal crop, and all the
productions of the Torrid Zone thrive. The labor
of Siam is done by Chinese coolies; for the native
workers are hampered by a law which requires them
to give one-fourth of their labor to the state. Domestic
elephants are used in hauling timber,&mdash;for teak
is one of the products of the forests,&mdash;and also for
travel and as bearers of burdens. Wild elephants are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
hunted and trapped in Siam; and tigers, bears, deer,
monkeys, and wild pigs abound in the jungles. Crocodiles
live at the mouths of the rivers; and the cobra,
python, and other reptiles are plentiful enough.</p>

<p>"The Siamese are peaceable people, lazy, and without
what you call 'snap.' They are fond of jewelry
and high colors. They are rather small in stature,
and very like the natives of the several islands you
have visited. They live for the most part on rice,
used largely in various curries, dried fish in small
quantities, though the rivers and sea swarm with
fish. Tea is the favorite beverage, taken without
sugar or milk. Though they distil an intoxicating
liquor from rice, a tipsy person is rarely seen. They
chew betel-nut, males and females; and their teeth
are always black, which is their ideal of beauty, and
they use other materials to make them black and
shining.</p>

<p>"The worst vice of the Siamese is gambling; but
it can be practised only in houses licensed by the
government, though on certain holidays, New Year's
in April especially, the people are privileged to
gamble at home, or even in the streets. Marriages
are arranged by women of mature age. The birthdays
of the contracting parties must be agreeable;
for the people are superstitious, and consult the stars
for their horoscopes. The old ladies agree upon the
amount of money the parents of the bride and groom
must pay to set up the young couple in life. The
ceremonies last three days or more; and the principal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
observance is the chewing of betel, winding up with
a feast to all the friends. Priests are sometimes
called in to say prayers, and sprinkle the couple with
consecrated water.</p>

<p>"The Siamese believe that the arteries of the body
are filled with air, and that disease is caused by
some disturbance in these internal breezes. A wind
blows on the heart, and bursts it, causing death by
'heart failure.' Almost everything is pressed into
the <i>materia medica</i> for service, including such things
as cats' eyes, the bile of snakes, sea-shells, horns,
and probably dogs' tails, kittens' teeth, and monkeys'
tongues. Doctors are paid by the job, and not by
the number of visits. The price of a cure is agreed
upon; and if the patient dies, or fails to get better,
the physician gets nothing.</p>

<p>"After poor people, dying, have been kept a few
days, they are cremated, as in India; but they keep
a high noble nearly a year before they commit his
remains to the fire. When called upon, a Siamese
farmer or other person is compelled by law to furnish
transportation and board to travelling officials.
The law of debit and credit is curious, and amounts
to actual slavery. A man may borrow money, and
give his person for security. If he fails to pay as
agreed, the creditor can put him in irons, if need
be, and compel him to work for him till the debt is
discharged,&mdash;the principal only, for his labor is the
equivalent of the interest.</p>

<p>"Missionaries are sent here from America, includ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>ing
many female physicians; and they have a great
deal of influence among the natives.</p>

<p>"The present king of Siam is Chulalongkorn I.
The former system of having the country ruled by
two kings has been abolished, and the present monarch
is the only king; and I never could find out
what the second king was for. The throne is now
hereditary, but the king formerly had the privilege of
naming his own successor. Chulalongkorn is an amiable
and dignified ruler, well educated, and speaks
English fluently. The laws are made by the king
in connection with a council of ministers. The forty-one
provinces of the kingdom are in charge of commissioners
appointed by the king. Such a thing as
justice is hardly known, and what there is of it is
very badly managed. Thieving and plundering are
carried on almost without check in Bangkok, which
includes about all there is of Siam except a great
deal of spare territory, and property is very unsafe
there. I think I have wearied you, Mr. Commander,
and ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" shouted several.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the Siamese twins, General
Noury?" inquired Uncle Moses.</p>

<p>"I never did; but I have read about them, and
looked them up this morning," replied the lecturer.
"They were born in Siam in 1811, but their parents
were Chinese. I don't quite understand in what
manner they were united."</p>

<p>"There was a ligament, which looked something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
like a small wrist, reaching from one to the other at
the breast-bones. Their garments were open enough
to enable the spectators to see this connection.
There was a great deal of speculation among the
doctors about them, I remember, and it was even
proposed to separate them with the knife; but that
was never done, for it would have spoiled the exhibition
business," the trustee explained.</p>

<p>"They were purchased of their mother at Meklong
by an American in 1829, and taken to the
United States, where they were exhibited all over
the country, and then taken to England. It was
a good speculation to Mr. Hunter and to Chang and
Eng, the twins; for they all made their fortunes.
They were married to two sisters, and settled in
North Carolina, where they had children. They lost
their property in the Civil War, and again exhibited
themselves in England in 1869. They died in 1874,
one living two hours and a half after the death of
the other."</p>

<p>The general retired from the rostrum; and the
party separated, Mrs. Mingo ascending the fore-rigging,
while the others went to various parts of the
ship to see the shores, which were still in sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>ON THE VOYAGE TO SAIGON</h3>


<p>The steamer was obliged to descend the Menam at
less than half speed, to avoid running down any of
the multitude of boats and vessels that thronged the
river, and because the stream was so crooked.</p>

<p>"How far do you think Bangkok is from the Gulf,
Captain Ringgold?" asked the general, at the close
of the session.</p>

<p>"About twenty miles," replied the commander.</p>

<p>"One description of the city that I have read
makes it forty miles, another twenty-six, and three
others make it twenty miles," added the pacha;
"and I suppose the last is the right distance."</p>

<p>"I have come to that conclusion after consulting
all the books we have on the subject. You have
said the second king of Burma had been abolished,
General; are you confident that such is the case?
We certainly did not see him, and I did not hear
anything about him," added the captain.</p>

<p>"In the first place, I consider Chambers excellent
authority, and you have the latest edition in the
library, and the date is last year; and it says in
so many words that the second has been done away
with. The king who was the father of Chulalong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>korn
died in 1868. His prime minister was a progressive
man, who introduced many reforms in Siam;
and I am sure that he could not have helped seeing
the absurdity of the second king. The present king
is well educated, and also a progressive man, as his
father was not. I am sorry we did not look the
matter up, which we might easily have done with
the assistance of the missionaries. But I am satisfied
that I was correct in regard to the statement."</p>

<p>In the course of another hour the ship came to
the mouth of the river. Crocodiles appear to prefer
the mouth of a stream, and a considerable number
were seen at the entrance to a canal or cut-off.
The pilot stopped the screw, and backed it, in order
to avoid a collision with a couple of vessels in the
channel. As the two vessels were under sail, it
looked as though it would be some time before the
channel was clear; and the "Big Four" hastened to
their staterooms for their repeating-rifles.</p>

<p>Their appearance thus armed created a sensation
on the upper deck, and all the party secured positions
where they could see the sport. Mrs. Belgrave manifested
some anxiety when she saw the arms, for she
was somewhat afraid of such weapons.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Louis?" she asked
as her son passed her.</p>

<p>"Don't you see that there are a dozen crocodiles
at the mouth of that cut-off, mother?" replied Louis.
"We are going to shoot some of them."</p>

<p>"But you can't get them if you do kill them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"We don't want to get them. They are not good
for anything to us."</p>

<p>"Then, why do you want to kill them? They do
you no harm," protested the lady.</p>

<p>"But they would if they got the chance. Suppose
by any accident some one should fall overboard;
those brutes would snap the person up as a fish snaps
the bait," answered Louis. "In Borneo they are regular
man-eaters, more dangerous than sharks; and
I have no doubt they are the same here. As I told
you, they pay so much a foot for killing them in that
island. Ask the pilot how it is here, mother."</p>

<p>Achang was called, and was asked to inquire of
the Siamese if the crocodiles were dangerous. He
promptly replied that they were not only dangerous,
but a nuisance; for they went ashore and swallowed
all small animals, and even attacked a cow. The
lady offered no further objection. She only hoped
the Nimrods would not shoot each other; and they
descended to the platform of the gangway, which
had not yet been hoisted up, and the crack of their
rifles was soon heard.</p>

<p>Each of the rifles could send out nine bullets, fixed
ammunition, contained in cartridges, nine of which
was the capacity of the magazine. Those on deck
watched the group of saurians; but Louis fired the
first shot, and immediately there was a sensation
among the reptiles. One of them made a spring,
and came over on his back.</p>

<p>"Mr. Belgrave fired that shot," said Achang to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the hunter's mother. "He is dead shot, and he
never miss his aim."</p>

<p>"There is another turning over on his back,"
added the lady.</p>

<p>"I think Mr. McGavonty fired that one; for he is
a dead shot too, but not quite so sure as Mr. Belgrave,"
said Achang; and he was correct in his
supposition. Both of them hit the crocodile in
the eye.</p>

<p>The next report that reached the ears of the party
was followed by five more in quick succession; and
the Bornean explained that the hunter had missed
his aim five times out of six, but his victim turned
over after the last one.</p>

<p>"Mr. Scott is better with lasso than with rifle,"
criticised Achang, with a smile.</p>

<p>The next shot caused the fourth of the reptiles to
upset himself on the water, and then the screw of
the ship began to turn again. The crocodile's reasoning
powers did not seem to be well developed, as
Mrs. Belgrave suggested when she saw one of their
number killed; for they might have known there
was mischief in the air. The Nimrods came on deck,
and then carried their rifles to their staterooms,
where the commander required them to lock up the
weapons in their closets.</p>

<p>The third officer was ordered to have the gangway
hoisted up when he returned to the deck, and
the ship proceeded to sea. The weather was pleasant,
and not very warm for the tropics; in fact, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
had suffered more from the heat in New York and
in Von Blonk Park than in Bangkok, though it is
sometimes extremely hot there. The south-west
monsoon cooled the air where they were, though the
sun poured down its blistering rays.</p>

<p>There was an awning over the platform where the
conferences were held, and another over the after
part of the promenade deck. But the former, with
its arm-chairs, was the most desirable location to be
had; and in a short time the company had seated
themselves there without any call to attend a lecture.
As soon as deep water was indicated by the soundings,
the pilot was discharged, and the captain then
gave out the course south by east. Everything was
in working order on board; and the commander
joined the party on the promenade, as it had always
been called before Conference Hall was located there.
It commanded the best view on both sides, though
not forward, where it was obstructed by the pilot-house.</p>

<p>"What have you seen in Bangkok, Miss Blanche,
that the absentees have not seen?" asked Louis,
who had seated himself at her side, after patting
Miss Mingo, whom she was holding in her lap.</p>

<p>"A great many things," she replied. "One was
the royal barge, which they said was rowed or
paddled by one hundred and fifty men; but a good
many of us did not believe it contained so many."</p>

<p>"I have read about it, though I did not see it.
It is said to be one hundred and fifty feet long, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the book I read said it was paddled by one hundred
and twenty men," added Louis. "But it does not
make much difference, and the books do not agree in
regard to a great many things in this part of the
world. What did you think of the people you saw,
Miss Blanche?"</p>

<p>"A lady and gentleman were pointed out to us
by one of the kind missionaries who guided us, and
I could hardly tell which was the lady and which
the gentleman till I had studied them a while,"
returned the fair maiden. "Both of them wore what
appeared to be trousers; but it proved to be a cloth
as big as a sheet wound around the waist, and so
disposed about the legs as to look like trousers; but
the garment was the same on both of them. The
lady had something like a shawl, which was passed
over the left shoulder, and under the right arm,
with some kind of a jacket under it. The gentleman
wore a sort of tunic, which was regularly buttoned
up in front like a coat. The hair of each was
shaved off close to the head, except a tuft on the
crown, which was bunched up. They wore no ornaments
of any kind, perhaps because it was not a
dress occasion. I saw one woman who had a kind
of necklace on the top of the shawl."</p>

<p>"I saw a woman's band of five pieces, and the
music they made was not bad," added Louis.</p>

<p>"I heard a band like that; but I could not tell
whether they played a tune or improvised their
music. The missionaries took us into the garden of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a nobleman, where we saw what was called a theatrical
exhibition; but it was no more like a theatre
than it was like a cattle-show. We saw the king
too, and he was a nice-looking man forty years old.
He had what looked like a tunnel on his head. He
was sitting in a kind of big arm-chair on poles, and
eight men were bearing him to a temple. All the
natives in the street dropped on their knees as he
passed, and some lay flat on their stomachs. That
is the way they always do before him. But he
chews betel; and his mouth was as black as though
he had just eaten a piece of huckleberry-pie, and it
looked horrid. That is all the fault I have to find
with him."</p>

<p>"It is a bad habit the people here have; but it
is not so bad as drinking whiskey, and we must be
charitable while our country has its faults; and theirs
only spoils their looks, though I have been told there
is a 'kick,' or exhilaration, in the use of betel. I
don't think I should ever fall in love with a girl
who chewed betel-nut. Some Dyak maidens would
have been passably good-looking if their teeth and
lips had not been blackened with this drug."</p>

<p>"The missionaries took some of us into the private
chapel of a nobleman. There were about a hundred
priests, all clothed in yellow robes, with their heads
shaven; the service consisted of the constant repetition
of a sentence, which a missionary told me meant
'So be it.' It reminded me of the howling dervishes
we visited at their monastery, whose service was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
monotonous repetition of 'Allah il Allah,' You went
to some of the temples, Mr. Belgrave, and they seem
to me to be all alike. Now can you tell me how far
it is to the place where we are going next?"</p>

<p>"It is about six hundred miles to Saigon, the chief
town of French Cochin China, and we shall get there
to-morrow," replied Louis. "You must brush up
your French, Miss Blanche, for we have not used
it lately."</p>

<p>"We are off Cape Liant now, and I must give out
a new course," said the commander, rising from his
chair by the side of Mrs. Belgrave.</p>

<p>"South-east half-south!" called the captain at the
side window of the pilot-house.</p>

<p>"South-east half-south," repeated the quartermaster
at the wheel.</p>

<p>"We are going to Saigon, you said, Mr. Belgrave;
but I cannot pronounce the name," added the young
lady.</p>

<p>"As to that, you pays your money, and takes
your choice," laughed Louis. "The French call it
Sah-gong, shutting out the full sound of the last <i>g</i>,"
added the speaker, pronouncing it several times with
the proper <i>accent</i>. "The English call it Sy-go&#324;, I
believe; but I have heard it called variously at
Sarawak."</p>

<p>"But we want to know something about it before
we go there," said the young lady. "We had to
ask no end of questions about Siam because the
lecture was postponed for the absentees."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"After lunch to-day a short talk will be given in
relation to Saigon," replied Louis, as the bell rang
for that meal.</p>

<p>When the company gathered in Conference Hall,
Louis was introduced as the speaker for the occasion,
and promptly presented himself before his audience.</p>

<p>"I have very little to say, Mr. Commander, for
General Noury has covered the whole subject under
the head of Cochin China," he began. "What is
more particularly known as French Cochin China
contains 23,000 square miles, and a population of
1,800,000. The part in the north is called French
Indo-China. The country is precisely that described
so carefully by the general, and I need not repeat it.
The Cambodia, or Mekhong River, flows through it
with many bayous or cut-offs. On one of these,
which is called the Saigon River, is the city of Saigon,
the capital of the French possessions in the
East, Lippincott says thirty-five miles, and Chambers
sixty miles, from the China Sea; and of course both
of them cannot be right, and you are all at liberty
to take your choice. The town has grown up within
the last thirty-two years; and, after the style of
French cities, it is handsomely laid out, with fine
streets, squares and boulevards. It contains numerous
canals, with stone or brick quays; and perhaps it
will remind you of Paris along the Seine. It is said
to be one of the handsomest cities of the East. It
has a navy-yard and citadel, and is the most important
port between Hong-Kong and Singapore. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
people are French, Annamese, and Chinese. It has
a large trade, and contains two colleges, an orphan
asylum, a splendid botanical garden, to say nothing
of convents and other institutions. The population
is put by one at ninety thousand, and by another
at about half that number. I have nothing more to
say."</p>

<p>Louis retired, and the next day the ship arrived
at Saigon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>IN THE DOMINIONS OF THE FRENCH</h3>


<p>It was not a long voyage from Bangkok to the
mouth of the Mekhong River; and the sight of land
was not as thrilling an incident as it had often been
in the experience of the voyagers, and they were
not in condition to appreciate the feelings of Captain
Columbus when Watling's Island broke on his vision
four hundred years before. It had been smooth sailing
all the way; the Gulf of Siam had been as gentle
and affectionate as a maiden among the flowers, and
the China Sea was scarcely more ruffled.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaskette had finished up his new map of
Cochin China, so that it was as creditable to his skill
and taste as his former efforts had been; and it was
displayed on the frame in Conference Hall, which
was the usual sitting apartment of the company,
though some of them did a great deal of walking on
the promenade deck. The water was deeper inshore
than farther out at sea, where several spots were
marked at eight fathoms; and the passengers had
a view of the land before they were within a hundred
miles of the entrance of Saigon River.</p>

<p>"There is a broad opening in the coast, which must
be the Cambodia, or Mekhong River," said Morris.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is Batac Bay, with a large island in the
middle of it," replied Captain Ringgold. "It is one
of the mouths of the Mekhong; for there is a Delta
here extending about a hundred miles, the Saigon
River being the most easterly."</p>

<p>"Mekhong seems to me a new word, though doubtless
it was the native name of the great river; but
when I went to school we never called it anything
but the Cambodia," added Uncle Moses.</p>

<p>"It is now called by both names, and both are
usually found on the maps and charts," said the commander.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later he pointed out the mouth
of the great river. All the land was very low, and
much of it was sometimes under water. Felix had
become the owner of an excellent spy-glass, which he
had purchased at second-hand at Aden; and he made
abundant use of it. It was too large to be worn in
a sling at his side, and he always carried it in his
hand when the ship was in sight of land. After
lunch, in the middle of the afternoon, he stationed
himself in front of the pilot-house, and kept a sharp
lookout ahead.</p>

<p>"Saigon light!" he shouted, some time before it
could be made out without a glass.</p>

<p>The steamer was headed for Cape St. Jacques, near
the entrance to the river by which she was to reach
the city. The light soon came into view, and a boat
was seen pulling out of the mouth. The signal for
a pilot had been displayed on the ship, and one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the men in it was believed to be the person desired.
The screw was stopped as he approached her, and the
ladder lowered for his ascent to the deck. As usual,
all the passengers wanted to see him. He was an old
man, or at least well along in years.</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir," said Louis, who had gone to the
main deck with the third officer to receive him; and
he spoke to him in French.</p>

<p>He was conducted to the promenade deck, and presented
to the captain. He said that he was born in
France, but had been in Cochin China nearly thirty
years. He was first sent down to Monsieur Odervie
for a lunch after he had given the course, and the
ship continued on her way. The cook was very glad
to meet a compatriot; and, as he was getting dinner,
he had several nice dishes, from which he treated
his new friend. But the pilot's services were soon
needed in the pilot-house. He spoke a little English,
consisting mainly of nautical terms.</p>

<p>He took his place on the starboard side of the
wheel, with Quartermaster Bangs on the other side,
steering himself; perhaps because he was not willing
to trust his English in giving orders. But the quartermaster
seconded all his movements, and they
steered together in silence. The ship was soon well
in the river, and the passengers had enough to do in
observing the shores on both sides.</p>

<p>There were many openings in the banks of bayous
and cut-offs, and the land was as flat as it had been
during the last hundred miles of the voyage. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
soil was very rich, and produced abundant crops
where it was cultivated. A very few villages were
to be seen; but each of them had its temple or pagoda,
and the houses hardly differed from those they
had seen in Siam.</p>

<p>"I suppose this is all an alluvial soil, Brother
Avoirdupois," said Dr. Hawkes, as the ship was
passing a rice-field.</p>

<p>"So say the books I have consulted, Brother
Adipose Tissue. It is just the right land for rice,
and that is the staple product of all this region,"
replied Uncle Moses.</p>

<p>Both of these gentlemen weighed about two hundred
and twenty-six pounds apiece, and they continued
to call each other by the appropriate names they
had given each other even before the ship left New
York on her voyage all over the world.</p>

<p>"What is alluvial soil, Doctor?" asked Mrs. Blossom,
who had read very little besides her Bible and
denominational newspaper.</p>

<p>"It is the soil or mud which is brought to its
location by the action of water; and here it is
brought down by the mighty river which spreads
itself out into a delta where we are," replied the
doctor good-naturedly, and without a smile at the
ignorance of the worthy lady; for though her education
had been greatly neglected, she was esteemed
and respected by all on board, for in sickness she
had been the nurse of the patients. "It is just the
right soil for rice," he added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have seen so many rice-fields out here, that I
should like to know something more about them,"
suggested the good lady.</p>

<p>"Naturalists class it as a kind of grass; but I will
not vex you with any hard words. Rice is the food
of about one-third of all the people on the globe. It
requires heat and moisture for its growth, and it is
raised in considerable quantities on the low lands of
Georgia and South Carolina and elsewhere in our
country. The plant grows from one to six feet high.
I don't know much about the culture of this grain
in the East; but in South Carolina they first dig
trenches, in the bottom of which the rice is sown in
rows eighteen inches apart. The plantation is prepared
so that water can be let in and drawn off as
desired. As soon as the seed is sown, the water
is let in till the ground is covered to the depth of
several inches. As soon as the rice comes up, the
water is drawn off, and the plant grows in the open
air rapidly under the hot sun. The field is again
flooded for a couple of weeks, to kill the weeds, and
again when the grain is ripening. The rice is in
a hull, like wheat and other grains; and you have
found parts of this covering in the rice when you were
cooking it. It is threshed out by hand or machinery
after it is dried, and then it is ready for market.
There is a rice-field on your right; and you can see
the channels which have been dug to convey the
water to the plants, or to draw it off," said the
surgeon in conclusion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see them, Dr. Hawkes; and I am very much
obliged to you for taking so much pains to instruct
an ignorant body like me," replied Mrs. Blossom.</p>

<p>"It is quite impossible for any of us to know
everything, and I often find myself entirely ignorant
in regard to some things; and I have lived long
enough to forget many things that I learned when
I was younger," added the doctor with a softening
smile.</p>

<p>The villages increased in number and in size as
the ship approached the city; though they were about
the same thing, except that in the larger ones the
temple was a handsomer structure.</p>

<p>"How far is it from the sea to Saigon?" asked
Bangs, speaking to the pilot for the first time; but
the Frenchman could not understand him, and the
quartermaster called Louis in, who repeated the question
in French.</p>

<p>"Sixty miles if you go one way; thirty-five by
another," Louis translated the reply.</p>

<p>"That may account for the difference in the distance
given in the books," said the captain, who was
in the pilot-house. "But the information we obtain
from what are considered the authorities is so various
on the same subject that I don't know where the
fault is."</p>

<p>"This is the largest village we have seen," said
Louis to the pilot in French.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and the next place is Saigon," replied
the Frenchman; but he was so much occupied with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
his duty that he would not talk much, even in his
own language.</p>

<p>The city was soon in sight, and the pilot began to
feel about for the bell-pull. He spoke to Louis, and
the quartermaster was told to ring the speed-bell.
A little later, off the town, the gong sounded for
the screw to stop. The anchor was all ready, was
let go, and the steamer swung round to her cable.
The Blanche had not so readily obtained a pilot
as her consort, and she was an hour behind her in
arriving.</p>

<p>The Guardian-Mother was surrounded by boats as
soon as she was at rest, but the boatmen kept their
distance till the port physician and the custom-house
officials came on board. Both ships passed the ordeal
of the examination, and the boats closed up.
They were manned by all sorts of people, and they
were in all sorts of craft. The captain said that
most of them were Chinese sampans, and the boatmen
were of the same nation.</p>

<p>"There comes the Blanchita!" exclaimed Felix,
who was walking about the deck with his spy-glass
under his arm.</p>

<p>"They got her overboard in a very short time,"
said the captain, who had joined the company on
the promenade. "I am glad she is coming, for I
desire to see the general."</p>

<p>The gangway had already been rigged out; and the
launch came alongside the platform, containing General
Noury, his wife, the rajah, Captain and Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Sharp, Dr. Henderson, the surgeon of the Blanche,
and the French maid of the princess. They were
warmly greeted on the platform by the commander
and Louis, and the ladies were assisted from the
boat. They mounted to the deck; and the usual
hugging, kissing, and handshaking followed in the
boudoir.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have come, General Noury," said
Captain Ringgold, after he had shaken hands with
everybody. "We have been shut up on shipboard
for some time now; and as we have come to a French
city, I propose to take my party to a hotel for a
day or two. Of course you can do as you please,
General."</p>

<p>"I like the idea, Captain, if there is a decent
hotel here," replied the pacha. "What do you
think, Zuleima?" he asked, turning to his wife.</p>

<p>"I like it very much; and the hotel cannot be any
worse than some we have lived in on our yacht voyages,"
replied the princess.</p>

<p>"Here is the medical officer, and he can tell us
something about the hotels," suggested the commander.</p>

<p>The doctor was consulted by the general in French,
and he said the H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe was very good.
The entire party of both ships were invited to go
on shore, and remain at the hotel. All of them accepted,
including Captain Sharp and his wife. Those
on board the Guardian-Mother went below to prepare
for the shore, and the Blanchita returned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the Blanche for the same purpose. The gentlemen
were on deck again in a few minutes.</p>

<p>"A visitor to see you, Mr. Scott," said a seaman,
approaching the third officer as he came from the
cabin.</p>

<p>"Captain Rayburn!" exclaimed Scott as soon as
he caught sight of the visitor. "I am very glad to
see you, Captain;" and the young officer grasped
his hand.</p>

<p>"I am quite as pleased to see you, Captain Scott,
though I hardly knew you," replied the English
captain.</p>

<p>"I am no longer captain, though I am the third
officer of this ship; and I did not wear my uniform
when I met you at Kuching."</p>

<p>"How are the rest of your party?" inquired the
captain of the Delhi.</p>

<p>"Very well, and here they are."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to see you on board of your own
ship, Mr. Belgrave," said Captain Rayburn, rushing
to the young millionaire as he came on deck with his
bag in his hand.</p>

<p>Felix and Morris soon appeared, and gave the captain
a hearty greeting. The commander happened to
pass near them, and he was approached by Scott.</p>

<p>"Captain Ringgold, allow me to introduce Captain
Rayburn, of the steamer Delhi, to whom the Borneo
party are greatly indebted for his kindness; and the
Blanchita sailed in company of his ship from Kuching
to forty miles inside of Point Cambodia."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Captain Rayburn, I am very happy to meet you;
and I am glad of the opportunity to thank you for
your kindness to my young men, and especially for
standing by the Blanchita during the worst part of
her voyage to Bangkok. But we are all going ashore
at once to spend a day or two at the H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe;
and I cordially invite you to be my guest."</p>

<p>After some objections to the plan, he accepted the
invitation. He was well dressed, and a gentleman
in every sense of the word. He ordered the men in
his boat to return to the Delhi, and to bring off certain
garments to the hotel. The Blanchita came up
to the gangway again, and the party embarked in her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>A LIVELY EVENING AT THE HOTEL</h3>


<p>The Blanchita had been painted since her return
from Borneo, and she had a decidedly holiday appearance.
Captain Rayburn had been introduced
to all the ladies and gentlemen on board; and in the
steam-launch he was presented to General Noury and
his wife, and to the others of the Blanche. The port
physician went on shore with them, pointed out to
them the landing-place, and directed them to the
hotel.</p>

<p>The party landed, and found the hotel "good
enough," though hardly in the slang sense of the
phrase. Apartments were obtained for all, and dinner
was ordered. Captain Rayburn had been a couple of
days in Saigon, and had learned something about the
city. He was the guide of the Nimrods when they
took a walk before dinner. They went through the
French portion of the place, where they found the
streets broad, and ornamented with trees. The houses
were seldom more than two stories high.</p>

<p>The governor's palace was a magnificent residence
for Cochin China, and the cathedral was also a fine
building; but after going half over the world the
young voyagers did not find much to attract them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>They were more interested in what the country itself
produced than in what had been brought from
France. There was a European garrison in the citadel;
but the natives were enlisted as soldiers, and
drilled in French tactics. The promenaders met a
squad of the latter. They wore blue blouses, white
pants, and a flat cork-lined cap; but they did not
wear shoes, and they looked very odd to the visitors
in their bare feet.</p>

<p>The walk ended with a visit to the botanical garden;
but the tropical plants were what they had been
seeing for two months, and they were not a novelty
to them. The foreign plants and trees were more
interesting to them, and they had been set out with
a view of ascertaining what were adapted to the soil
and climate of the country.</p>

<p>"This place consists really of three towns united,"
said Captain Rayburn as they walked back to the
hotel. "It was formerly but a group of fishing villages,
though even then it was the capital. Pingeh is
the commercial town, on the west side of the river,
and Cholon is the native quarter. The citadel or
fortress is in Pingeh, but we have not time to visit
either of them to-night."</p>

<p>"You have been here before, Captain?" asked
Louis.</p>

<p>"Not in the Delhi. I was for some years the commander
of one of the P. &amp; O. steamers; but I was
taken very sick six months ago, and was obliged to
spend three months in Calcutta. When I got well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a merchant there who had been a good friend of mine
during my illness, was in a great strait to find a captain
for the Delhi in place of one who had died. I
agreed to take her for a single voyage; for she is
a very small craft for me, as I have been in command
of ships of six thousand tons. I shall return to my
steamer when she comes to Calcutta in a couple of
months."</p>

<p>"I thought you were too big a man to be in command
of such a puny vessel as the Delhi," added
Scott.</p>

<p>"I took charge of her only to accommodate my
friend her owner. I don't find any fault with her,
except that she is old and very slow," added the
captain as they came to the hotel.</p>

<p>"Ah, Captain Rayburn, how do you do?" exclaimed
a gentleman, extending his hand to him.
"I was a passenger in your ship to Hong-Kong last
year."</p>

<p>"O Monsieur Fr&ocirc;ler!" replied Captain Rayburn,
grasping the proffered hand. "Of course I remember
you very well, for I don't often get so fully
acquainted with my passengers as I did with you;
and I only wished I could talk French with you.
But you speak English as well as I can, so that
it made no difference. Do you reside here?"</p>

<p>"I went from Hong-Kong to Canton, and several
other Chinese cities, and then to Japan, after we
parted, and finally I came here. I like the place,
and have been here six months," replied the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
gentleman, who was not over thirty years of age.
"I live at this hotel; and we have a great American
party here, with an English steamer that has a
Moorish pacha on board with his wife, who is an
Indian princess, so the landlord told me; and I
wish to be introduced to them."</p>

<p>"I can assist you to that, Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler. Are you
in business here?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Not at all; my father made my fortune for me,
and I do nothing but travel, and when I come to
a place I like I stay there as long as I please; and
I am doing that here."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler, allow me to present to you Mr. Louis
Belgrave, the owner of the Guardian-Mother, the
American steam-yacht in the river," continued Captain
Rayburn.</p>

<p>The French gentleman received the young man
with the greatest deference and politeness, and introduced
him to his companion. A conversation in
French followed; for Louis was inclined to use that
language when he could, to keep "his tongue in,"
as he put it. Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler told him that he was well
acquainted in the city with all the principal men,
and was familiar with all the localities. He would
be very happy to escort the party wherever they
wished to go, and to introduce them to the governor
and other officers of the army and officials.</p>

<p>Louis then conducted the Frenchman to the large
parlor where the tourists were waiting for dinner,
and introduced him to Captain Ringgold, who re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>ceived
him with his usual politeness. While Louis
was introducing him to all the members of the party,
Captain Rayburn informed the commander that he
had first met Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler when in command of a
P. &amp; O. steamer.</p>

<p>"Were you in command of a P. &amp; O. steamer?"
asked Captain Ringgold, opening his eyes very wide.</p>

<p>"I am still in command of one," replied the English
captain; and then explained how he happened
to be in the Delhi. "Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler was really the
most agreeable passenger I ever had, and I became
very intimate with him. He is very wealthy, and
travels all the time, though he sometimes stops a
year in a place. He is a high-toned gentleman in
every sense of the word. He is acquainted with
the principal merchants and all the officials in
Saigon, and desires to assist your party in seeing
the city and its surroundings."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly be very grateful to him for his
services," replied the commander, as Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler approached
them after making his round of introductions
with Louis.</p>

<p>The Frenchman formally tendered his assistance
to the party, and they were gratefully accepted by
the commander. Of course he was invited to dinner
with the party; and the seat of honor on the right
of the captain was given to him, while that on the
left was appropriated to Captain Rayburn. The
princess was placed next to the Frenchman, with the
pacha next. The others took seats to suit themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The dinner was excellent, and Dr. Hawkes wondered
if Monsieur Odervie had not had a hand in its
preparation; and this afterwards proved to be the
case. French cooks are very fraternal; and when
one of them is to get up a great dinner, his <i>confr&egrave;res</i>
generally tender their assistance to him. As no dinner
was to be served that day on the steamer, Monsieur
Odervie had obtained leave of absence, and called
upon the cook of the hotel. His proffered aid was
accepted, and the surgeon was confident he had made
the sauce for the excellent fish that was served.</p>

<p>It was a lively party at the table, for the guests
were desirous of knowing more about the mission
of the Guardian-Mother all over the world; and their
curiosity was gratified, the pacha telling the Frenchman
all about it in the language of the latter. No
wine was served, for the reason that none was ordered,
doubtless greatly to the regret of the landlord;
and the commander made an explanation, though not
an apology.</p>

<p>"I am a Frenchman, but I drink no wine," said
Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler; "for the reason that it does not agree
with me. I have great respect for my stomach; for
it is very serviceable to me, like my watch, if I keep
it in good order. I drank no wine nor liquor in Paris,
and still less would I do so in a tropical country."</p>

<p>"I am in the same boat with my friend Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler.
The P. &amp; O. Company does not encourage its
captains to drink anything; and when I entered the
service as a fourth officer, I knocked off entirely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
afloat or ashore; and I have stuck to my text ever
since," added Captain Rayburn.</p>

<p>"Then our teetotal habits do not interfere at all
with our guests."</p>

<p>"Not at all," added both of them.</p>

<p>"Did you know that the captain of your consort
from Borneo was a commander in the P. &amp; O. service,
Mr. Belgrave?" asked Captain Ringgold.</p>

<p>"I did not till this evening; I knew that he was
a gentleman, and that was all that I wished to know,"
replied Louis.</p>

<p>This remark was applauded warmly by the company.
The captain then said that he wished to
introduce the guests of the occasion over again,
though they had been presented individually to all
the company. He wished to say that Captain Rayburn
was actually the commander of a P. &amp; O.
steamer of six thousand tons, on leave of absence on
account of sickness. He also told them something
more about the Frenchman. He was a gentleman
whose father had made his fortune for him, as he
expressed himself; he was not engaged in any business,
and held no official position. He was travelling
only for his own amusement and instruction,
and his stay in Saigon had been prolonged to six
months.</p>

<p>As the party left the table, Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler had a
little talk for a few minutes, when he excused himself,
and left the hotel, promising to return in half
an hour. Conversation was resumed in the parlor;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and presently Mrs. Belgrave started one of the familiar
hymns when she found a piano in the room,
in which the captain of the Delhi joined with a tremendous
bass voice.</p>

<p>While the music was in full blast, Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler entered
the apartment, accompanied by two ladies and
two gentlemen, both of the latter wearing the decoration
of the Legion of Honor. It was evident that
the visitors were magnates of Saigon; and Mrs. Belgrave
rose from the instrument, and the singing was
discontinued.</p>

<p>"I have the pleasure of presenting to Your Excellency,
Captain Ringgold, commander of the steamer
Guardian-Mother, visiting Saigon with the company
of tourists here present," said Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler, leading
up one of the strangers. "Captain Ringgold, I have
the honor to introduce to you His Excellency the
Governor of French Cochin China."</p>

<p>The two gentlemen then shook hands. Louis Belgrave
was then presented, followed by General Noury
and his wife; and the pacha then took His excellency
to every member of the party, and presented
each in due form. While this was in process, Mr.
Fr&ocirc;ler presented to the commander the other gentleman,
who appeared to be about fifty years old, as
Monsieur Larousse, merchant of the city; and Louis
followed the general in introducing him to the members
of the party. The master of ceremonies next
led up to Captain Ringgold the two ladies, presenting
them as Madame and Mademoiselle Larousse;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and they appeared to be the wife and daughter of
the elderly gentleman who had preceded them.</p>

<p>The daughter was a beautiful lady, apparently
about twenty-four years old, though it is not always
practicable to state the age of a French lady. By
this time General Noury had made his round, and
the governor was passed over to Mrs. Noury, at his
request. The commander made the circuit with
Madame Larousse, and the pacha offered his services
to conduct Mademoiselle Larousse. He presented
her to his wife first, interrupting her <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with
His Excellency for a moment.</p>

<p>"Pretty woman," said Captain Rayburn to Captain
Ringgold.</p>

<p>"Very pretty," replied the latter.</p>

<p>"Between you and me, she is the particular reason
why Fr&ocirc;ler has prolonged his stay here to six
months."</p>

<p>"Then I congratulate him," added the commander.</p>

<p>"Her father is not rich; Fr&ocirc;ler does not care for
that, for he is a multi-millionaire himself, counted
in francs. But the prettiest lady here is the sister
of Morris, Miss Blanche."</p>

<p>"Madame Noury, you were singing when I came
in," said the governor when the introductions had
been completed.</p>

<p>"But they were singing American hymns, not
adapted to your religion or mine," replied Mrs.
Noury.</p>

<p>"I don't care for that," he added; and both spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
French. "I liked what I heard very much, and I
should wish to hear some more of it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Belgrave was called, and the request repeated
to her in English by the magnate. And so it happened
that the rest of the evening was passed in
singing gospel hymns. At a late hour the company
separated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>TONQUIN AND SIGHTS IN CHOLON</h3>


<p>There was so little sight-seeing to be done in
Saigon that the tired tourists did not hurry themselves
in the morning; for breakfast was not served
till nine o'clock, and they went to the tables at their
own pleasure. The Nimrods had risen at an early
hour, and had taken a long walk before any others
came from their rooms. They were the first to take
the morning meal, and they had earned an appetite
before the regular hour for it. At half-past ten a
number of vehicles had been gathered by the landlord
for the use of his guests.</p>

<p>Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler was in attendance as soon as breakfast
was <i>ready</i>, and the young <i>men</i> took their meal with
him. He seemed to have taken a fancy to Louis
when he learned that the Guardian-Mother was his
college, and he took pains to inform him in regard
to the affairs of the city and the country.</p>

<p>"How did the French happen to settle here in the
beginning?" asked Louis when they were seated at
the table.</p>

<p>"England, Holland, Spain, and especially France,
began to take an interest in the countries of the East
at a very early date; and France entered the race<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
for Oriental territory as early as 1787, and agreed
to assist Annam in its troubles. Two years later
the French Revolution broke out in the destruction
of the Bastille, on the fourteenth of July, which is
still celebrated. It is our 'Fourth of July,' Mr.
Belgrave."</p>

<p>"I was in Paris on that day a few years ago,
when I was a smaller boy than I am now, and I
wondered that no fire-crackers were let off," replied
Louis.</p>

<p>"They are not permitted in Paris. France had
her hands full after the Revolution began, and was
unable to keep her agreement in full with Annam;
but missionaries were sent there, and some commercial
relations in a very small way were continued
until 1831. Then the king died, and was succeeded
by one who did not believe in the missionaries,
French and Spanish, settled in Annam, as the whole
country east of Siam was then called. The new king
wanted to drive away the bearers of the gospel to
the natives, and killed or persecuted them.</p>

<p>"Twenty years later, France found it necessary
to interfere, which she did by sending a small army
to subdue the country. The fortifications which
had been built by French engineers held the soldiers
back to some extent. When the persecutions of the
Christians were believed to be ended, the French soldiers
returned home. They were again renewed; and
France and Spain sent out a fleet and army, which
captured the principal seaport, and continued the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
war for about four years, when a treaty of peace was
concluded. Annam was compelled to pay 25,000,000
francs for the expense of the war, and permit every
person to enjoy his own religious belief. The missionaries
were to be protected, commercial relations
were established, and in 1886 a treaty was ratified at
Hu&eacute;, by which the country was placed under the
protection of France, though the native princes were
nominally continued in power. This was the beginning
of the French dominion in this region."</p>

<p>"If it is not one now, it will eventually become
a French colony," suggested Louis.</p>

<p>"Probably it will, for it is largely so now," replied
Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler.</p>

<p>Captain Ringgold, who had waited for Mrs. Belgrave,
finished breakfast about the same time; for
they had not listened to a historical talk while they
were eating, and they left the room together. At the
time appointed for the ride, all the party were in the
parlor, and they were loaded into the vehicles. They
rode through the principal streets, and to the botanical
garden, where all the party walked through the
grounds. Then they rode along the banks of the river.</p>

<p>"Those small vessels look like men-of-war," said
Louis, who was seated in the first carriage, with Mr.
Fr&ocirc;ler, the commander, and Mrs. Belgrave.</p>

<p>"They are little gunboats, and the government
has about twenty of them," replied the Frenchman.
"But I think we had better alight here, and take
a general view of the river and the surroundings."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>At a given signal the whole party got out of the
vehicles.</p>

<p>"But what are those gunboats for, Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler?"
asked Louis, as the company were looking at them.</p>

<p>"If there should happen to be a riot, or a disturbance
of any kind, up the river, which the police
could not handle, they would be used for transporting
troops; for we have the telegraph here, and could
be notified at once. They are also used to beat off
pirates, and to see that the laws are obeyed."</p>

<p>"Pirates!" exclaimed Louis. "Are there any
about <i>this</i> country?"</p>

<p>"They are not such pirates as we read about in
olden times," replied Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler with a smile. "But
some of these natives may rig up a boat, and go on a
predatory excursion among their neighbors, especially
in the fishing regions on the Great Lake, over two
hundred miles up the river. Their principal plunder
is fish, though they take anything they can lay their
hands upon."</p>

<p>"I should hardly call them pirates," added Louis.</p>

<p>"But Chinese pirates have been known to capture
vessels in the China Sea, off the coast of Tonquin."</p>

<p>"I have heard of such within a few years."</p>

<p>"You can see the citadel, as it is called here,
though it would be simply a fort in most places.
There are 1,830 French soldiers here, and 2,800
native troops. Only 3,000 of the population are
French. The last census gave the country a population
of 2,034,453," continued Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler, consulting a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
memorandum book he carried in his pocket. "They
are mainly Annamites; but Cambodians, Chinese, savages
from the north, and Malays contribute to make
up the number. But I don't mean to lecture you, as
I am told you are addressed on board your ship by
some of your own number."</p>

<p>"But we are an educational institution in part,
and we are very glad to hear you," said the commander.
"We are supposed to be greedy for information
about the countries we visit. I suppose we
are about as near Tongking as we shall be, and I am
sure my company would like to learn something more
about it. We have a nice place here in the shade of
this tree to hear a short lecture."</p>

<p>"You use the English name for the region, which
is all right; and I have seen it spelled Tonkin, which
I think is better yet for your people. The French
name is Tonquin," (and he gave the French pronunciation).
"It is larger than Cochin China; and we
apply this name to what you designate as French
Cochin China, for it has an area of 34,740 square
miles, and a population supposed to be about 9,000,000.
Its chief town is Hano&iuml;, consisting of a number of
villages, with 150,000 inhabitants; and its chief seaport
is Hai-Phong. There has been war going on
against the people of this country for many years."</p>

<p>"We read something about these operations in
American papers, and know very little about Tonquin,
which is the reason I asked for more knowledge
of the region," added the commander.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"The principal productions of Tonquin," Mr.
Fr&ocirc;ler, bowing to the captain, proceeded, "are rice,
silk, sugar, pepper, oil, cotton, tobacco, and fruits,
with copper and iron in small quantities. The exports
are now 13,325,000 francs, which you reduce to
dollars by dividing by five. The imports are nearly
28,000,000 francs, only one-fourth from France, with
but a small portion of the exports to that country.
An expedition was sent out from home, at the instance
of Jules Ferry, to open the way by the Songkoi
River for the trade of Yun-Nan, a south-western
province of China. The experiment was an expensive
one, and the difficulty of navigation in the upper
waters of the river made it a failure. The troops
met with a disaster; and the colonial policy of the
statesman here and in Madagascar caused his ruin,
and he has since died. Jules Ferry was nicknamed
'le Tonquinais.' But I have talked too long."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" protested several of the company;
for they had read in the papers at home something
in short paragraphs about the war and other matters
in Tonquin, which they did not understand; and
they are likely to read much more in the future,
which they will comprehend better if they remember
the brief account of Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler.</p>

<p>The party got into the vehicles again, but stopped
soon after at the market, where they alighted. Natives
in boats and on foot were bringing in fruits
and vegetables in great quantities. All the fruits of
the tropics were included, though bananas were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
most plentiful. Some came with clumsy carts, loaded
with the produce of the surrounding country. The
vehicles were very trying to the nerves of the ladies
and some of the gentlemen; for they creaked and
groaned, and seemed to be screeching for grease,
reminding them of the carts of Lisbon, where some
of the party had had a similar experience.</p>

<p>"The men here wear tunnels on their heads, after
the fashion of the king of Siam," said Morris as they
walked through the market, which consisted mainly
of an open square, filled with carts, barrows, and
baskets.</p>

<p>"The head-covering of the women is more curious,"
added Scott. "It is about two feet across, and they
use them as umbrellas, both sexes."</p>

<p>"I see that you have the yellow dog here, Mr.
Fr&ocirc;ler, as in Constantinople," said Louis, as the
Frenchman came near with the captain and Mrs.
Belgrave.</p>

<p>"They are outcast dogs, like those in Constantinople,"
replied the guide. "Nobody owns them, and
they have to pick up their living in the streets.
They are no more honest than some of the natives;
for some of them will steal a piece of meat, and then
comes a fight with all the others in the vicinity."</p>

<p>"Where does the meat used here come from?"
asked Louis.</p>

<p>"From Cambodia," replied the Frenchman. "But
it is about time for your lunch at the hotel, and I
think we had better return. I see that your steam-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>launch
is at the landing-place; and we might go up
to Cholon in her, and visit the citadel."</p>

<p>The suggestion was adopted; and on his arrival at
the hotel, the commander found a note from the
governor, inviting the party to dine with him that
day at seven. It was promptly accepted; and after
the lunch the party embarked in the Blanchita, and
sailed up the river to Cholon, which is the native
portion of the city.</p>

<p>"It does not cost much here to build a house,"
said Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler, as the yacht, under the pilotage of
the old Frenchman who had brought the Guardian-Mother
up the river, worked her way through the
multitude of boats that thronged the shore.</p>

<p>But the young men were busy observing the various
craft; for they were of all sorts and kinds, from
the simple Chinese sampan to the craft fifty feet
long, provided with a cabin, and parts of her covered
with the leaf awning, something like what they had
seen in Borneo.</p>

<p>"Where does this boat come from, Achang?" asked
Felix.</p>

<p>The Bornean spoke to a man who seemed to be the
captain and a Malay.</p>

<p>"She come from Great Lake," reported Achang.
"She bring down dry fish to sell to the poor people
of Cholon."</p>

<p>"How much does it cost to build one of these
houses, Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler?" asked Captain Ringgold, after
they had looked over some of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"About twenty-five francs."</p>

<p>"It ought not to cost more than that, for they
are nothing but shanties," replied the commander.
"Some of them are built on floats, as in Bangkok."</p>

<p>"Let us look into one of them; they will not object.
This is a Chinaman's abode, and he belongs to
the better class here," said the Frenchman as he led
the way into the house, followed by the commander,
with Mrs. Belgrave on his arm.</p>

<p>Seated at a table was what a sailor would call a
kid, or small tub, containing a stew of fish and vegetables;
and there was a dish for each individual,
which did duty as a plate. There were a man, a
woman, and three children at the table.</p>

<p>"These people belong to the aristocracy," said the
Frenchman, as they retired, and the family were visited
by others of the party. "We will look into another
house of a lower grade of people;" and they
went into a hut about six feet square, in which were
eight men, women, and children, huddled together
around a tub on the floor containing fish and rice.
The odor was not agreeable, and they hurried away.</p>

<p>"You noticed the two girls there. If you want
them, Captain, you can buy them for thirty dollars
apiece of your money."</p>

<p>"I don't want them; and I don't care about staying
any longer in this part of the town," replied the
commander.</p>

<p>They walked rather hurriedly to the yacht. On
the way they met a carriage something like a wheel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>barrow,
with a single large wheel, and a seat on each
side of it, one occupied by a fat Chinaman and the
other by a Malay. It was propelled by a native just
like an ordinary wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>"That's a big team," said Scott.</p>

<p>"You will see plenty of them in some of the cities
of China."</p>

<p>The Blanchita left Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler at the landing-place,
and then conveyed the passengers to the two ships;
for the ladies insisted that they must dress for the
dinner at the governor's palace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>SEVERAL HILARIOUS FROLICS</h3>


<p>The ladies certainly did dress for the occasion; and
not only the ladies, but all the gentlemen. The captain
put on a new uniform which he had not worn
since his ship left Colombo. Scott had a new uniform
also; Uncle Moses, the surgeon, Mr. Woolridge,
and the professor came out in evening costume, with
black dress-coats; and the young men were clothed
for their age, in black. The ship's company looked
at them with astonishment when they came on deck,
for they had never seen them <i>en grand tenue</i> before.</p>

<p>The ladies were properly costumed for the dinner,
and all of them wore the best they had. When the
Blanchita came alongside the ship with the Blanche's
party, more surprise was manifested; for Mrs. Noury
was dressed as a princess, as she was, with the richest
garments of India; General Noury clothed in
the full costume of his Moroccan rank, a dress which
had not been seen before. Captain Sharp wore his
uniform, and his wife proved that no money had been
spared on her dress and adornings. The rajah wore
his Indian suit, made of the costliest materials and
the most brilliant colors, and rubies and diamonds
sparkled upon him, as on the pacha. Dr. Henderson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
was in keeping with his professional brother of the
other party.</p>

<p>The seats of the yacht had been overlaid with rugs
and other materials, that the rich costumes need not
be soiled. The Blanche's barge came soon with the
Italian band on board; for the general desired to serenade
the governor during the evening. It was an
hour too early; for the commander had been so solicitous
that the company should not be late, that he had
overdone the matter. The landlord was to have the
carriages at the landing at half-past six, and there
was an hour to wait. But the princess and Mrs.
Sharp declined to leave their seats in the launch, for
fear of mussing up their dresses; and the general
called upon the band to play while they were waiting.</p>

<p>It was near the close of a clear day, and the music
was delightful. In a short time not less than a hundred
boats surrounded the ship, and three times as
many people stood upon the shore. The band had
not played before since their arrival. Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler, in
Parisian evening dress, had come to the landing to
receive the party, and when he heard the music, he
came off, standing up in a sampan; for he was as careful
of his garments as the ladies. The captain had
ordered a carpet to be placed on the steps of the
gangway, and the polite Frenchman ascended to the
deck without peril to his clothing.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Captain Ringgold," said he, extending
his hand. "You have the most ravishing music
here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is General Noury's Italian band, and he will
take it ashore to serenade the governor," replied the
commander.</p>

<p>"I have not seen your steamer before, and she is
a magnificent vessel," added the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"I should be happy to show her to you; but we
have hardly time to do so now, for I see that the
ladies are taking their places in the launch," answered
Captain Ringgold; "but I shall ask the governor
and such ladies and gentlemen as you will
designate to spend the afternoon and evening on
board to-morrow, dining in the cabin. I arranged it
with the general. Both ships will be visited, the
band will play, and we will make a general frolic of
it. The next morning we shall sail for Manila."</p>

<p>Both of the gentlemen hastened to the gangway to
assist the ladies as soon as the commander saw Mrs.
Belgrave moving in that direction. Miss Blanche,
conducted by Louis, appeared about the same time.
Her costume was very neat, though not showy; but
she was as beautiful as a fairy, and the Frenchman
clasped his hands in ecstasy when he saw her. In a
short time they were all seated in the Blanchita, and
the gentlemen then took their places.</p>

<p>Precisely at twenty minutes past six Captain
Sharp, prompted by Captain Ringgold, gave the order
to cast off. A quartermaster of the Blanche was at
the wheel, and in five minutes she was alongside the
shore. A <i>platform of clean boards, covered with a
carpet</i>, had been laid down by the landlord of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe, and the vehicles were in waiting.
The ladies were handed from the boat to the carriages
without a spot or a splash on their dresses,
though the shore was very muddy.</p>

<p>In ten minutes more the head of the procession
reached the governor's palace. There they found an
awning over the sidewalk, and <i>carpets laid</i> down for
the guests to walk upon. The French, English, and
American flags were flying on the building. The
ladies were conducted to the grand entrance of the
palace, and taken by the servants to the apartments
set apart for clothing. There were not less than a
thousand natives and French people gathered in the
vicinity, but they were kept in admirable order by
the Malay police. The pacha's band was admitted
to the grounds, and Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler was acting as chief
marshal; he notified them when the party began to
descend the stairs, and the music commenced then.
They came down in couples, Captain Ringgold and
Mrs. Belgrave leading, followed by the pacha and the
princess.</p>

<p>His Excellency stood at the head of the large
apartment, and received them as they advanced. He
was a widower and childless, so that he had no wife
nor daughter to present. Louis and Miss Blanche
were the next, though the commander had proposed
that Louis should come next to him and his mother;
but Louis rebelled, and insisted that he should follow
the pacha. The rajah came next, and had Mrs.
Blossom on his arm, to the no small amusement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the party; but the deposed sovereign prince could
find no other lady disengaged.</p>

<p>Possibly Mr. Woolridge and wife were disconcerted
to come next; but their daughter had been properly
honored, and both were too fond of Blanche to be
troubled about the precedence. Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler stood by
the governor, and announced the names of the members
of the party; for His Excellency could hardly be
expected to remember them. But he was very cordial
to all of them, speaking in his broken English,
except to the pacha and Louis. Some of the gentlemen
had to present themselves without ladies; but
there were at least twenty ladies and gentlemen
seated around the room. After all the party from
the ships had been received by the governor, they
were introduced to the other visitors. Some of the
Saigonians could speak English, and some could not;
but the conversation soon became general. The commander
and Mrs. Belgrave found enough who could
speak English. There were seven persons among the
tourists who could converse fluently in French, and
Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler employed these as interpreters for those
who could not speak the polite language.</p>

<p>The scene was quite amusing to all; and even the
governor laughed heartily as he looked about him,
and saw the struggles in the matter of language.
The chief marshal proved to be a very potent functionary,
and he was omnipresent in the apartment.
When the governor spoke to him in praise of Miss
Blanche, he immediately sent Louis with her to His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Excellency. The room was the audience chamber
of the palace, and the magnate of the occasion invited
her to a seat on the dais at his side. She
could speak French a little; and it was soon observed
that she was enjoying herself very much, and the
governor even more.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp was passed over to Louis, and he made
the grand round with her. The princess was instructed
to do the same with Mr. Woolridge, while
the professor rendered the same service to Mrs. Woolridge.
The rajah escorted Mrs. Blossom around the
chamber, and the poor woman was in a flutter all the
time. The long robe of the Indian prince bothered
her, and she had been nearly tripped up several
times; but her new beau was as polite and deferential
as though she had been a queen. She had a
story to tell the gossips of Von Blonk Park which
would last her the rest of her lifetime. It was even
a livelier time than that at the hotel, made so by the
confusion of tongues, which was not far short of
that at the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>The dinner was announced by the major-domo of
the household. Ignoring the houris of the occasion,
the polite governor escorted Mrs. Belgrave to the
table, and seated her on his right, while the captain
of the Guardian-Mother conducted the princess.
Those of the gentlemen who could speak French
were requested by Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler to attend the resident
ladies; and the most distinguished was placed in
charge of the pacha. The <i>contretemps</i> of language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
were frequent and laughable; and so much amusement
was derived from this source that some of the
visitors purposely made bulls to keep up the hilarity.</p>

<p>The dinner was a very elegant as well as a very
substantial affair. Monsieur Odervie and other
French cooks fraternized as usual on this great occasion;
and the table was ornamented with many set
pieces, and one from the citadel produced a Buddhist
temple in sugar, which was the admiration of the
guests; and doubtless all these culinary artists would
assist the <i>chef</i> of the Guardian-Mother for the great
dinner of the following day. But it would require
a considerable volume to detail all the occurrences
of the governor's banquet. A speech was made by
His Excellency in French, which was replied to by
Captain Ringgold, without knowing much of what
had been said; but Louis followed him in a few
remarks in French, thanking the governor and the
residents of the city for their kindness and hospitality.</p>

<p>The pacha made the speech of the evening in the
vernacular of the host, which was violently applauded
by the residents, especially by the military
officers from the citadel, who had been informed that
he was the commander-in-chief of the armies of his
country. The Italian band had been brought into
the palace, feasted, and stationed in the great hall,
where they discoursed their finest music, to the great
delight of the guests. Dancing followed, and the
governor led Mrs. Noury to the floor. The rajah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
asked Mrs. Blossom to dance with him; but she did
not know a step, and if she ever in her life regretted
that she could not dance, it was on this occasion.
The commander of the citadel and chief officer of
the army of Cochin China led out Mrs. Noury, and
the next in rank to His Excellency who could speak
English was favored by Miss Blanche.</p>

<p>It was kept up till after midnight; and then the
tourists returned to the ships, visiting the hotel the
next forenoon to obtain their baggage. All the party
at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> of the governor had been invited to the
ships; and the Blanchita conveyed them from the
landing in two trips, one to the Guardian-Mother,
and the other to the Blanche. The guests were
shown over both steamers, and they expressed their
admiration in both languages. All the officers were
kept busy, especially Mr. Gaskette, who spoke French.
Every passenger was a host or hostess, and the confusion
of tongues created as much merriment as it
had at the palace. Captain Ringgold devoted himself
especially to the governor. The Italian band
played all the time on the deck of the Blanche,
which was hardly a ship's length from her consort.</p>

<p>After a light lunch had been served in the cabins
of both steamers, the party on board of the Guardian-Mother,
with their hosts, were conveyed to the
Blanche, where they spent a couple of hours, and had
a dance on her promenade deck under an awning.
Every part of the ship was visited; and after a stay
of two hours, the entire company was conveyed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
two trips to the Guardian-Mother. When some of
the guests asked how the passengers contrived to
amuse themselves on the long voyage, Mrs. Belgrave
organized a section of them, and played Blindman's
Buff, Turning the Cover, Copenhagen, and other
games, to the intense delight of the guests.</p>

<p>At six o'clock dinner was announced. Monsieur
Odervie had had the assistance of not less than four
<i>chefs</i> all day; and several set pieces in varied ingredients,
original and artistic, adorned the two tables.
The bill of fare had been printed in the city, and of
course it was all French. The occasion was much
the same as at the palace, with all the confusion of
tongues. At the close of the dinner Captain Ringgold
made his speech, which the governor could
understand, and the chief official of the province responded
in his own language. Several others were
heard; and when Dr. Hawkes attempted to make
a speech in the polite language, he excited bursts of
laughter, and it was soon evident that he was speaking
for the fun of it. His gestures were more French
than his speech, which he interlarded with English
and Latin. Uncle Moses made a remark in the latter
language, which only the doctor and the professor
could understand; but it was as vigorously applauded
as though every word had been comprehended.</p>

<p>After dinner the governor called for some singing,
and gospel hymns were introduced. Captain Rayburn
was one of the guests on board, and his heavy
bass was the crowning glory of the music.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The ship had been illuminated, and the band played
at times on the deck. The governor wanted some
more of Mrs. Belgrave's games, and they were repeated
in the music-room. The Cupids, as the two
fat gentlemen had been named in Egypt, did their
best on this occasion,&mdash;rolled on the floor, and were
as antic as boys.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when the Blanchita began to
convey the guests to the shore; and the adieux were
very cordial, with many regrets that the ships must
depart so soon. The river was so full of boats that
the launch had some difficulty in making her way to
the shore; but the Malay police soon made an opening
for her.</p>

<p>Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler had been invited to sleep on board, as
had Captain Rayburn; and both accepted, the former
returning to the ship after he had seen his ladies
home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>THE VOYAGE ACROSS THE CHINA SEA</h3>


<p>The tide was right at six o'clock in the morning,
and the order had been given the night before to sail
at this hour. Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler and Captain Rayburn were
on deck before this time; and the latter took a boat
to his vessel, after very hearty thanks for the pleasure
he had enjoyed.</p>

<p>"I don't feel at all like leaving your steamer, Captain
Ringgold, but I suppose I must," said the French
gentleman, as the commander took him by the hand
in the morning.</p>

<p>"I am as sorry to have you leave as you are to
do so," replied the captain. "We have seen the
place, and made the acquaintance of quite a number
of the people. In fact, you have turned our visit into
a general frolic, and I am sure my party have never
enjoyed themselves more than during the past two
days; and we owe it all to you, Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler."</p>

<p>"You praise my feeble efforts to enable you to see
the place and some of the people more than they
deserve," replied the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"When I meet you in New York, I shall do my
best to reciprocate your very kind and hospitable reception,
and I am confident all my passengers will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
do the same. I should be most happy to have you
continue on board."</p>

<p>"I should avail myself of your very kind invitation
so far as to go to Manila if there were a line of
steamers between that port and Saigon. But I should
have to go by the way of Singapore. With your permission,
I will go down the river with you."</p>

<p>"What is this coming alongside?" asked the captain,
as he moved over to the rail.</p>

<p>"It is one of the gunboats, Captain," answered
Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler. "There is the governor on her deck
and two ladies. His Excellency has come off to say
good-by to you."</p>

<p>"He is very considerate."</p>

<p>"And there is the landlord of the hotel."</p>

<p>"I paid his bill yesterday afternoon, and for
everything up to this morning," said the commander
as he hastened down the gangway to receive the governor.</p>

<p>On his way he called Louis, who was on deck
early, and directed him to have the stewards call all
the passengers, and to inform them that His Excellency
was coming on board. The distinguished official
was received by the captain, and conducted to the
deck. It was a cordial greeting on both sides. The
governor declared that he had never enjoyed himself
more than on the day before, and he should go down
the river for the purpose of saying his adieux to the
party.</p>

<p>The gunboat would escort the ships to Cape St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Jacques, and he would return with it. In ten minutes
after the call the passengers began to come on
deck, and the governor greeted them as though they
had been his friends for years. He was a jolly old
fellow, and made himself as familiar with the tourists
as though they had been his intimate friends.
When Miss Blanche came up he rushed to her, and
took her by both hands. Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler suggested that
the governor had come more to see the beautiful
women on board than for any other purpose.</p>

<p>The barge was hastily dropped into the water, and
sent for the passengers of the Blanche, the third officer
being in charge of the message. The landlord
of the hotel said he had come on board to pay his
respects to his late guests, and he would go down the
river with them. The barge returned after some
delay, for none of her party were out of their rooms.
They warmly welcomed the governor and the captain
of the gunboat, who had been one of the guests the
day before.</p>

<p>Both ships got under way at once, for the anchors
had been hove short. Mr. Sage and the cook were
set to work. The governor divided his attentions between
Mrs. Noury and Miss Blanche; and the pacha
was not at all disturbed by his old Mohammedan
notions about wives. The rajah took Mrs. Blossom
on his arm, and promenaded the upper deck with
her under the awnings.</p>

<p>"Faix! Oi belayve the ould feller manes to marry
her," said Felix.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, Flix! He is a Mohammedan, and she
is a Methodist, and neither of them would consent
to marry the other," replied Louis.</p>

<p>"He knows she's a fust-rate nuss, and that's what
he needs. Oi'll give my free consint to it," added
Felix, as Louis was called away.</p>

<p>The three hours' run to the sea was a continuation
of the frolic of the day before, even including the
games. At nine o'clock, with the ship in a sheltered
bay, breakfast was served; and it was as lively as all
the other meals had been. More speeches and a confusion
of tongues followed. The two ladies who had
come off in the gunboat were the lady who was said
to have detained Mr. Fr&ocirc;ler so long in Saigon, and
her mother; and they were treated with the utmost
consideration by all. The band played during the
breakfast, having been sent for by the pacha.</p>

<p>Everybody was so happy that Captain Ringgold
remained three hours longer than he had intended.
Then the time to separate came; and the parting was
long and difficult, bringing about another confusion
of tongues, but it was over at last. The gunboat
received her passengers for up the river; but the
craft did not go that way, and accompanied the two
steamers about five miles to sea, with the American
flag flying at the fore.</p>

<p>As the vessels were to separate finally, the gunboat
fired a salute of seven guns, which was returned
by both ships; and then they sped on their voyage of
eight hundred miles to Manila. The captain gave out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the course east by north half-north, and the French flag
was hauled down from the topmast. The passengers
of the Blanche had been sent on board of her, while
those of the Guardian-Mother continued to promenade
the deck. The commander noticed that some of
them were gaping and yawning, and he remembered
that they had had only three or four hours' sleep.</p>

<p>"I advise you all to turn in and finish your night's
sleep," said he. "Professor Giroud will give his lecture
on the Philippine Islands and Manila to-morrow
at half-past nine. There is nothing to do till
dinner-time. No lunch will be served to-day in the
cabin, for you have but just left the breakfast-table;
but any one can ring his bell, and send for whatever
is wanted."</p>

<p>The passengers seemed to think favorably of this
advice, for they all went below. There was nothing
to see; for there was not a single island in the course,
and the ship was soon out of sight of land, not to see
it again till she made Luban Island, off the entrance
to Manila Bay. The wind was almost dead ahead,
though it blew very gently; but this circumstance
soon attracted the attention of Scott, who had been so
busy with the frolics that he had not had time to consult
his books and chart.</p>

<p>It was not his watch; and he went to his stateroom,
returning very soon with the blue book that
goes with the chart of the Indian Ocean. He found
that there was an east monsoon which prevailed in
the China Sea north of the equator.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mr. Scott?" asked the captain
when he found him absorbed over his book.
"Do you think we are going wrong, or that there is
a typhoon within hail?"</p>

<p>"Neither, sir; I was looking to see why the wind
was east to-day," replied the third officer.</p>

<p>"You have discovered by this time that there is an
east monsoon coming in between those from the north-east
and south-west."</p>

<p>"But we did not find it coming up from Sarawak
to Bangkok," added the young officer.</p>

<p>"Your course carried you within between one hundred
and one hundred and fifty miles of the Malay
Peninsula. This and the great island of Sumatra
doubtless have some influence on the winds. Both of
these bodies of land are very hot; and, as the air from
them tends to the cooler atmosphere of the sea, they
favor the south-west monsoons. All these bodies of
land modify to some extent the prevailing winds."</p>

<p>Scott was satisfied with the explanation, for it conformed
with what he found in his book. When he
carried his authority back to his room, he turned in
and took his nap, in order to be ready for his watch
at eight bells in the afternoon watch. In fact, all but
the watch on deck were asleep.</p>

<p>The passengers seemed to be rather logy in their
movements and heavy of intellect, perhaps because
they had slept so well. It was cool at sea in comparison
with the shore, and they had by this time
become accustomed to extremely hot weather. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
they waked up before the meal was finished, and all
the talk was about the frolics of the last two days.</p>

<p>"What do you call the place where we go next,
Captain Ringgold?" asked Uncle Moses. "I see
it spelled in the books with a single <i>l</i> and with a
double <i>l</i>. Which is correct?"</p>

<p>"Both," replied the commander. "If you are writing
Spanish, you use one <i>l;</i> if you are writing English,
you may use two <i>l's</i>, though I don't believe in
doing so."</p>

<p>"Do the Spaniards ever double the <i>l?</i>"</p>

<p>"I will leave the professor to answer that question,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>"They never spell Manila with two <i>l's</i> when they
spell it correctly; for that would make another word
of it,&mdash;a common noun instead of a proper, and meaning
quite another thing," the professor explained.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am stupid, Professor, and I know next
to nothing of the Spanish language," added Uncle
Moses, "but I don't quite understand you. If a
Spaniard spelled the capital of the Philippine Islands
with a double <i>l</i> it wouldn't be the capital at all?"</p>

<p>"It would not."</p>

<p>"What would it be?"</p>

<p>"It would be something of which Miss Blanche
has a couple in her possession; and I may say the
same of every lady at the table," said the professor
with a cheerful smile on his face.</p>

<p>"But which no gentleman has?" suggested the
worthy trustee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't say that; for the word means in Spanish
a small hand."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh around the table, and
all the party held out their paws like dancing bears.</p>

<p>"Then Spaniards must be good spellers," said Dr.
Hawkes. "There is very great difference between
the capital of the Philippine Islands and Miss
Blanche's pretty little hands."</p>

<p>"<i>Ll</i>, which we call double <i>l</i>, is treated as one letter
in Spanish, and it has its own peculiar sound, nearly
equivalent to <i>ly</i> in English; and therefore Miss
Blanche's small hand would be called mah-nil-ya,
which is not the capital spoken off. The name of
all the islands is spelled in English with double <i>p</i>,&mdash;Philippine;
but that is not Spanish, though the
geographers have generally adopted that orthography.
The Spanish name is <i>Las Islas Filipinas</i>."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Professor; and I think I understand
it now," added Uncle Moses.</p>

<p>"<i>Quiera V. ense&ntilde;arme sus manillas, Signorina
Blanche?</i>" said Louis with a laugh. Of course she
did not understand him; and he added, "Will you
show me your small hands, Miss Blanche?" But
she did not do so.</p>

<p>"I should very much like to have all geographical
names reduced to a common standard, for I do not
believe in translating proper names," said the commander.
"I have been sometimes greatly bothered
by the difference in names. When I came to Aachen
in Belgium, I did not know where I was till I looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
in my guide-book, and found it was Aix-la-Chapelle.
Vienna has about three or four different names, and
people there would not know what you meant if you
called it as we do, or Vienne as the French write
and spell it."</p>

<p>"I think you are quite right, Mr. Commander,"
added the professor.</p>

<p>"But I have a few words to say about our voyage;
for I find it necessary to repress the ambition
of some of my passengers," continued the captain.
"Some of them wish to visit all the Philippine Islands,
and there are about two thousand of them."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" groaned some of the party.</p>

<p>"But the number I gave includes every rock, reef,
and shoal that lifts its head above the water. Some
call it twelve hundred. We will not stay to count
them; but there are many of them big enough to
have quite a number of towns on them. I wish to announce
that it will not be possible for us to go to any
of them except Manila, spelled with one <i>l</i>, and make
an excursion up the Pasig River, and to the lake.
But the ambition of the party is more expansive in
regard to China and Japan. As I have told you,
we can take only a specimen city in each country we
visit. Hong-Kong and Canton in China, with some
more northern port or city not yet selected, will be
enough to give us an idea of the Central Flowery
Nation."</p>

<p>The party left the cabin, and went on deck to
study the map of the islands they were to visit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PHILIPPINES</h3>


<p>The Guardian-Mother continued on her course
without encountering either typhoon or other tempest,
and her passengers kept very comfortable under
the awnings. The ship was in about 10&deg; of north latitude
and 110&deg; of east longitude. She was sailing with
the wind nearly dead ahead, and therefore the breeze
was good on deck, and even in the cabins.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the passengers were in their
chairs in Conference Hall, two of them occupied
by the siamangs, and the baby in the lap of Miss
Blanche, who had become very much attached to the
little creature. On the frame in front of the orang-outang
was a complete map of the Philippine Islands,
covering seventeen degrees of latitude, and ten of
longitude, with enough of the seas around them to
make their position clear to the audience.</p>

<p>Professor Giroud was introduced for this occasion
as the speaker; and he was received with more than
usual applause, for he had not occupied the rostrum as
much as formerly, General Noury having been kept
busy since his reappearance off Batavia. It may
be said that after the rest of the day before the
party were in excellent condition to be instructed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are sailing just now in comparatively shallow
water; and just to the south of us there are innumerable
shoals, with only from four to ten fathoms of
water on them. If the water were entirely drained
from the China Sea, the bottom would be like a hilly
region; for these numerous shoals would be the tops
of various elevations, and the same would be true
of a less extent north of us. The portion of the
sea over which we are now moving would appear to
be a considerable valley. You all have imagination
enough to see what I have described.</p>

<p>"All around the Philippines on the east and south
the water is from two to four thousand fathoms deep;
so that if the seas were dried up around them, these
islands would appear like a number of irregular
chains of mountains, and the highest peak would
be over 10,000 feet above the present surface of the
water.</p>

<p>"From north to south these islands extend about
a thousand miles, and from east to west about half
that distance, with the Sulu or Mindoro Sea four
hundred miles across it in either direction, nearly
enclosed within them; for the north-east coast of
Borneo is part of its boundary on the south. As
the commander mentioned at dinner last evening,
there are over two thousand islands in the group;
and leaving out those rocks and shoals which are not
big enough for a man to stand upon, there are
twelve hundred of them.</p>

<p>"On a map of the world, or even of Asia, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Philippine Islands occupy but a small space, and in
your school-days you have doubtless regarded them
as of but little importance; but several of the islands
are larger than any New England State, and two of
them are as large as Virginia and Ohio, and nearly
as large as New York and Pennsylvania. Luzon
and Mindanao," and the professor pointed to them
on the map, "the most northerly and the most southerly,
have each about 40,000 square miles, and the
area of all the islands is 116,000 miles. I think
most of you could have no idea from your study
of maps of the extent of the Philippines.</p>

<p>"Mindoro, the next island south of Luzon, has
9,000; and the others from 1,200 to 5,500. I shall
not mention or describe them separately. We shall
visit only Manila and the country near it, and you
would not remember even the names of the islands
over night. They are all mountainous and volcanic.
The highest mountain is Apo, in Mindanao, which is
10,400 feet high, and there are others of 9,000 feet.</p>

<p>"The islands are volcanic, and therefore subject
to earthquakes; and an instrument in Manila which
indicates vibrations of the earth is said to be shaking
about all the time. Several destructive ones are
recorded in the past. In 1863 Manila was nearly
destroyed by one, and the great southern island is
especially liable to them.</p>

<p>"The mountain ranges mostly extend north and
south; and there is space between them for some
considerable rivers, as the Rio Grande in Luzon has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
a course of 220 miles. The Agusan in Mindanao is
navigable for 60 miles. In this island are several
lakes, with rivers flowing from them. In addition
to which are many lacustrine basins."</p>

<p>"Spare us, Professor!" exclaimed Uncle Moses.</p>

<p>"The word comes from <i>lacus</i>, Latin for lake, and
applies here to such lakes as send their overflow to
the sea or other lakes by streams made by the rush
of water. But I don't use many such words, and I
hardly expected a classical scholar to object," replied
the professor.</p>

<p>"But I objected in behalf of several here who
never studied Latin; and besides the overflow is
entirely apart from the root of the word. But I
am satisfied, and the commander may invite you to
proceed," chuckled Brother Avoirdupois.</p>

<p>"On account of the high mountains and the
abundant sea-breezes, though hot and moist, this
group is not so unhealthy as most tropical islands
and countries. The fevers of hot countries are here
of the mild, intermittent kind"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is intermittent, Professor?" asked Felix.
"Is it the kind they don't have in Ireland?"</p>

<p>"I should say that it was."</p>

<p>"An intermittent fever, Felix, is one that comes
and goes, like the old woman's soap," interjected
Mrs. Blossom, the nurse; and everybody laughed to
hear her say anything.</p>

<p>"The diseases most dreaded in these islands are
consumption, dysentery, and an&aelig;mia"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mercy, Professor!" cried Mr. Woolridge.</p>

<p>"The reduction in the amount of blood in the
system, and the condition resulting from this loss,
is an&aelig;mia. Dr. Hawkes can explain it more fully,"
replied the professor.</p>

<p>"Not necessary," added the surgeon.</p>

<p>"As all over the Eastern Archipelago, there are
two seasons, the wet and the dry, produced by the
monsoons; but the irregularity of the surface variously
modifies the result. For the southern and
western sides of the mountains the south-west monsoons
give the wet season, and the north-east the
dry season, and <i>vice versa</i>. Manila is subjected by
the influence of the south-west winds to rains from
June to November, with dry weather the rest of
the year.</p>

<p>"The temperature is about the same all the year
round. The coolest month is December, when the
glass stays at about 77&deg;; and in May, the hottest
month, at 86&deg;. Of course there are days, and times
of day, when the temperature is lower than the one,
and higher than the other. The extremes where we
are going vary only about 25&deg;&mdash;from 66&deg; to 91&deg;; and
we have it hotter than the last in New York. The
average rainfall is about seventy inches, varying by
months from one-third of an inch in March, to
twenty inches in August.</p>

<p>"The flora of the islands is just what you would
expect in this climate. Nearly or quite all the
plants you have found in the other islands you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
have visited are to be found here. Particularly
plenteous here are the fibrous plants, and abaca
forms in its prepared state one of the most important
exports of the islands. This is a sort of
plantain from which comes the Manila hemp, as
it is sometimes called, though it is a misnomer;
and with us it is called simply manila, the sailors
tell me. It is extensively cultivated here, and
grows something like the banana.</p>

<p>"The stalks on which the leaves grow are split
into long strips, are threshed, combed, washed, and
dried, and then they become manila, of which many
of the ropes of this ship are made, though hemp
makes the better article. The finest fibres are
sometimes fifteen feet long, and from such some
very delicate manufactured goods are produced.
The coarser parts are used for cordage, which is
very serviceable. When we were at Nassau, in the
Island of New Providence, last year, we saw fields
of <i>sisal</i>, which has in late years come into use as
a substitute for common hemp and manila, and is
said to resist the action of sea-water better than
any other material.</p>

<p>"The fauna may seem to be quite limited to the
Nimrods of our company, for the large animals we
have found in other islands do not exist in the
Philippines. The buffalo and the gibbon are the
largest in the islands, with a variety of monkeys.
The elephant, tiger, rhinoceros, bear, and orang-outang
have no home here. The only dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
animals are the crocodile, serpents, and other reptiles.
If the Nimrods wish to hunt they will have
to try their hand at the wild buffaloes, though they
are not to be found near Manila.</p>

<p>"Birds are numerous and various, and especially
the gallinaceous bipeds, such as barnyard fowls,
grouse, and pheasants; but the most highly valued
here is the 'rooster,' if I may call him by his
common American name, for cock-fighting is one
of the national amusements of Spain and its dependencies.
You will see plenty of it in Manila,
if you are so disposed; but it is not an elevating
sport, any more than bull-fighting, which may possibly
prevail here. Coal and iron are the most
common minerals, with others; but mining is too
severe work for the enterprise of the people, and
I believe most of the mines of Cuba are worked
by Americans.</p>

<p>"The original inhabitants of the Philippines were
doubtless Negritos; and I hasten to explain the name
before I am 'picked up.' It was the word used by
the Spaniards to designate, not alone the negroes as
we find them in Africa, but those who are similar to
them. People of this race formerly inhabited all
these islands, but there are scarcely any of them left
at the present time. Hindus, Malays, and other
natives of the adjacent countries and islands, came
here, and the races mingled.</p>

<p>"The people found here at the present time have a
variety of names, beginning with the pure Spaniards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Creoles, Tagals, Chinese, and Mestizoes. The Spaniards
and the Tagals need no explanation, for the
latter are the pure natives of the islands. Creole, I
believe, is variously used in different locations; but
it is a Spanish word, coming from <i>criolla</i>, which
means grown up. They are one thing in the Spanish
West Indies, another in Brazil.</p>

<p>"A more general definition is a person born in any
country, but not of native blood. In the Philippines,
Creoles are the children of Spanish fathers and native
mothers. Mestizoes are children of Chinese parents
on one side and natives on the other. The last class
are usually called 'm&eacute;tis' in Manila and elsewhere.
You will doubtless see all of these classes, and with
a little practice will be able to identify them.</p>

<p>"The Spaniards of the islands are Catholics, often,
I am sorry to say, merely nominally such. Many of
the natives are Mohammedan, though the greater
portion are Catholic. The Philippines were discovered
by Magellan, as we generally call him, though
that was not his correct name, in 1521. He was
born in Portugal, and his name was Magalh&atilde;es. He
served as a soldier in Malacca and Morocco, and was
lamed for life in a battle in the latter. He did not
think his services were appreciated by his king, and
he offered them to Spain.</p>

<p>"He presented to Charles V. a plan for reaching
the Moluccas by sailing to the west; and, his scheme
being approved, he was fitted out with a fleet of five
ships. He passed through the straits south of Pata<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>gonia,
which still bear his name, crossed the great
ocean, to which he gave the name of Pacific, though
it was discovered by Balboa, who called it the South
Sea. Succeeding in his enterprise, he reached the
Philippines, after putting down a mutiny. He was
killed in an expedition he led in the islands. The
Victoria, his ship, returned to Spain in charge of one
of his subordinates, thus completing the first voyage
ever made around the world.</p>

<p>"There were several governments in the islands,
and most of them were conquered or conciliated so
that they came under Spanish rule; but the Mohammedans
of Sulu, the Archipelago north-east of Borneo,
and Mindanao retained their independence for a
long period, and they still retain their boundaries
and government.</p>

<p>"Manila has a population of 270,000, and there
are several other considerable towns with 30,000 or
more. There is a submarine cable to Hong Kong,
720 miles of telegraph, and 16 miles of railroad out
of Manila. The army consists of 4,800 men, with
3,500 gendarmerie, or police, such as ride in pairs
all over Spain. It has a navy of two corvettes, six
<i>avisos</i>, or despatch vessels, sixteen gunboats, with
2,000 sailors and marines. I believe I have told you
all that is necessary to know about the Philippine
Islands in a general way; and I thank you for your
attention through the long talk I have given you," the
professor concluded, and retired from the rostrum in
the midst of the hearty applause bestowed upon him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think we all know more about the Philippines
than we ever knew before, though I have been there;
and to-morrow I shall have something to say, very
briefly, about the city of Manila," said the commander.</p>

<p>"When shall we get there, Captain?" asked Dr.
Hawkes.</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow morning; but I shall lay off
so as not to get there at three in the morning."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>THE DESCRIPTION OF AN EARTHQUAKY CITY</h3>


<p>In the afternoon of the second day out Professor
Giroud called his pupils together in the library,
which was the schoolroom of the ship, and resumed
the lessons which had been interrupted since the arrival
at Sarawak. The long intermission had sharpened
the intellects of the class, and they were very
earnest in their studies. But it could be only for
the afternoon and the next day, for the commander
was very diligent in the business of sight-seeing.</p>

<p>At half-past nine the next forenoon, the passengers
were all assembled in Conference Hall, as the captain
had appointed; and the siamangs, who spent much
of the time aloft running up and down and along the
foreyards, were in their usual places, for chairs had
been provided for them; and they looked as grave and
attentive as though they understood the whole of
the lecture. Captain Ringgold appeared on the rostrum,
after he had patted Mr. and Mrs. Mingo on the
head, and glanced at Miss Mingo in the lap of Miss
Blanche.</p>

<p>"Manila is the capital of all the Spanish possessions
in the East, as the professor has informed
you; it has a population of 270,000, which is 40,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
greater than Havana," he began. "It is on the
south-west coast of Luzon, 650 miles from Hong-Kong,
which is a run of about forty-seven hours for
the ship. It is located on both sides of the little
river Pasig, which is the outlet of Lake Bahia, or
the Lake of the Bay. When I was here many years
ago, I spoke Spanish enough to get along; but I
shall leave the language now to the professor and
Mr. Belgrave, for I forget most of it.</p>

<p>"In going to the city we have to pass through
Manila Bay, which is really a sea of itself; and,
though it is land-locked, it affords little if any protection
for vessels in heavy weather, for it is about
thirty miles long from north to south, and twenty-five
from east to west. A west or south-west wind
rakes it about the same as the ocean.</p>

<p>"The city forms a circle, with a piece of it cut off
on the bay; and the suburbs are on several islands
in the river and bay. To keep a clear channel, the
Pasig is extended into the bay between two piers,
with a fort at the end of one, and a lighthouse at
the end of the other. The anchorage in the bay is
good enough so far as holding ground is concerned,
except in the south-west monsoon, when vessels of
four hundred tons or more have to go to Cavite, ten
miles south south-west from the city; and their cargo
must be taken to and from them in lighters.</p>

<p>"The oldest part of Manila is on the southern
bank of the Pasig, and is strongly fortified; but it
has a dilapidated look, for it was founded in 1571.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
On the north side of the river is the Binondo
suburb, as it is called, which is more populous than
the old part. The foreign merchants live here, and
it is the more important commercial centre. You
would hardly know, if you waked from a sleep there,
whether you were in a Spanish or an Oriental city,
for you would see something of both. Gloomy-looking
churches, awkward towers, and heavily built stone
houses are mixed up with pleasant cottages in groves
of tropical trees. I believe the people are now inclined
to build more of wood than stone on account
of the prevalence of earthquakes, which shake down
the heavier structures, and crush the occupants under
the weight of the material.</p>

<p>"As in Burma and Siam, the cottages I mentioned
are built on posts; for the land is sometimes inundated,
and the water requires a free passage, or it would do
more mischief. In the month of August, nearly two
feet of water falls on a level; and it makes bad work
in the low places. The streets are wide and not
paved; and in the rainy season, with a foot or two
of water lying loose around, they become very nearly
impassable. The houses are built in Spanish fashion,
with a central court-yard. They are generally
two stories high; for in an earthquaky country like
this, where terra firma becomes terra shaky, the
people are not encouraged to erect buildings twenty
stories high, as in New York and Chicago.</p>

<p>"An iron suspension bridge connects the old town
with Binondo. It was formerly a stone bridge, built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
more than two hundred years ago, which was thrown
down by the earthquake of 1863. A street in the
new suburb, called the Escolto, seems to be the
Broadway of the city; for it is the great shopping
locality, and it is flanked with shops and stalls, filled
with people of various races. Beyond this the Chinese,
Tagals, and half-castes congregate in numerous
occupations, as jewellers, oil and soap dealers, confectioners,
painters, and those of other trades. Here
you will find plenty of gambling-houses, if you are
looking for them.</p>

<p>"As in Singapore, certain sections of the city are
given up to particular branches of business. At San
Fernando, there are immense cigar manufactories, like
the one you saw in Sevilla in Spain, where six thousand
women are employed; and probably as many are
to be found in some of them here," continued the
commander, consulting memoranda he took from his
pocket. "At Santo Mesa is a cordage manufactory;
at Alcaicerfa the Chinese have a landing-place for
their sampans; fishermen and weavers live at Tondo,
whose gardens supply the markets with fruit and
vegetables; Malate is the resort of the embroiderers;
Paco is favored by artists and artisans; and Santa
Ana and San Pedro Macati are health resorts."</p>

<p>"McCarty!" exclaimed Felix, as he caught what
sounded like an Irish name. "I wondher if he
comes from Kilkenny."</p>

<p>"A place, and not a man; and it did not come from
Kilkenny. It is a Spanish name, spelled Ma-ca-ti,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
replied the captain. "I have read off all these names
from my memoranda, not that I expect you to remember
them, but to show you how things work
here. All the buildings for public use in a capital
city are found here, and a cathedral, the palaces of
the governor-general and the archbishop, an elegant
town-house, churches, three colleges for young men,
and two for young women (not behind the times,
you see), a large theatre, probably not as large as
that in Barcelona, custom-house, barracks, etc. The
Prado is the largest public square, and is ornamented
with a statue of Charles IV., or Carlos, King of
Spain from 1788 to 1808; and I wonder there is not
one of Magellan, who discovered the islands, and lost
his life here.</p>

<p>"The streets of the city are lighted with kerosene-oil
lamps, and not with gas, for the reason that the
earthquakes made bad work of the latter; and the
works were destroyed in a hurricane in 1882, as was
half the city. They do not build houses of brick or
stone now, but of wood, the former being so destructive
of human life in an earthquake. The native
dwellings are constructed of bamboo, thatched with
the leaves of the nipa palm.</p>

<p>"Glass windows are not used here; but the flat
shell of a large oyster is substituted for glass, and
the sashes all slide horizontally. Both of these departures
from ordinary methods are said to be to
exclude the great heat; but I confess that I cannot
see it. I find among my memoranda that 21,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
women and 1,500 man are employed in making
cigars; which in Sevilla includes the putting up of
tobacco in papers for smoking, and it may be so
here. Before I close I wish to say that authorities
differ in regard to the population of the city; but
I think the professor was about right in putting it
at 270,000. Lippincott gives it with the suburbs at
160,000, and Chambers at nearly 300,000. You have
been patient and longer suffering than I intended you
should be, and I thank you."</p>

<p>The commander made his bow, and descended from
the rostrum. Hearty applause followed, and the
siamangs joined with repeated cries and squeaks.
Miss Mingo had fallen asleep in her comfortable
quarters; but the noise woke her with a start, and
she sprang to the shoulder of Miss Blanche, where
she gave her "Ra! Ra! Ra!" and the squeak
which is the "tiger" at the end of it. As the audience
left their chairs for a walk on the deck, Mr.
and Mrs. Mingo sprang into the fore-rigging, climbing
the shrouds, and over the futtock-shrouds, disdaining
to crawl through the lubber-hole to the top.</p>

<p>Miss Mingo looked up at them, and then sprang
into the rigging; for her strength and agility seemed
to have greatly increased since she came on board,
making it probable that the sea-air agreed with her.
But her mamma did not appear to be quite satisfied
with this venture; and she sprang over the futtocks,
and seized her with one arm as she began to mount
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Mingo ran up the topmast rigging, and seated
himself on the cross-trees. The anxious mother
looked at him a moment, and then darted down to
the deck with the baby in her arm. Then, seeing
Mrs. Belgrave seated in one of the arm-chairs on the
promenade, she carried Miss Mingo to her, placing
the infant in her lap. The lady immediately folded
the little one in her arms so that she could not
escape, caressing her so that she did not offer to
follow her mother up the rigging, though she watched
her ascent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mingo ascended to the cross-trees, where she
and the gentleman siamang seemed to hold a conference.
The latter then sprang up to the topgallant
yard, and was closely followed by his mate. They
turned somersets, and went through a variety of
athletic feats, which greatly interested their audience
on deck, who gave them a round of applause. They
seemed to understand and appreciate this manifestation
of approbation, for they attempted various other
feats.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mingo got hold of the topgallant halliards,
and finding them loose, swung out over the lee side
of the ship. Captain Ringgold was startled at this
movement. She swung out as far as she could, the
line yielding, and suddenly she dropped into the
water. The captain rang the gong to stop the screw,
and then to back it. If the siamang could swim at all,
she was very clumsy in the water; and the waves, for
there was considerable sea on, seemed to bother her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Clear away the second cutter, Mr. Gaskette!"
shouted the commander as soon as he had rung the
gong to stop the screw, and the ship was as nearly at
rest as she could be on the billows.</p>

<p>"All the second cutters, on deck!" shouted Biggs,
the boatswain, after he had piped his whistle, at the
order of the second officer.</p>

<p>The boat was swung out in as much haste as
though the cry had been "Man overboard!" and
her crew took their places in good order. The cutter
was lowered into the water, and the men gave way
on a favoring wave and went clear of the ship. They
pulled with all their might; and Lanark, the cockswain,
steered her for the siamang.</p>

<p>"Stand by, bowmen, to haul in the lady!" called
Mr. Gaskette, as the cutter approached the unhappy
animal. "In bows!" and the two bowmen tossed
their oars, and brought them down in place, the men
springing into the fore-sheets to seize hold of the
creature. "Way enough!"</p>

<p>It looked to those who were anxiously watching
the operations of the men, fearful that Miss Mingo
would become an orphan, as though the boat would
strike Mrs. Mingo, and kill her by the collision.</p>

<p>"Stern all!" cried Mr. Gaskette with energy.</p>

<p>The order was obeyed, and the cutter came to
a stop when near the animal. The bowmen were
reaching to get hold of her, when she made a vigorous
leap into the fore-sheets, grasping the rail as
she did so. She shook herself with all her might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
as soon as she was in the boat, and a cheer went up
from the deck of the ship. The lady then seated
herself on the little platform in the bow, and seemed
to be as happy as ever, and that was saying a great
deal.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="281" height="400" alt="She made a vigorous leap into the fore-sheets." title="She made a vigorous leap into the fore-sheets." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">She made a vigorous leap into the fore-sheets.</span></span><br />
<div class='right'><a href="#Page_267"><i>Page 267.</i></a></div></div>

<p>"Give way!" said Mr. Gaskette, laughing at the
apparent self-possession of Mrs. Mingo when her
troubles were over. The cutter came alongside the
ship under its davits, the falls were hooked on, and
the boat was hoisted up. The lady was the first
to leap from her place to the rail of the ship.</p>

<p>The passengers applauded as she moved aft; and
she replied with her usual cry, and ended it with a
squeak. She went directly to the promenade, which
she mounted, and then hastened to Mrs. Belgrave's
chair. She looked at her baby as though it had
been overboard. Miss Mingo's keeper had taken
care that the infant should not see her mother in the
water; and the little one could not have told what
was the matter if any one had asked her, first because
she did not know, and second for an obvious
reason.</p>

<p>The ship was going ahead again, and the captain
came to the promenade. He took the lady into the
sun, and persuaded her to lie down and dry herself.
She seemed to understand the matter, and stretched
herself out.</p>

<p>"What made her fall overboard, Captain?" asked
the lady&mdash;meaning Mrs. Belgrave this time, and not
the siamang.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"The fore topgallant halliard was not made fast
to the cleat, and when it ran out, it jerked her from
it," replied the commander. "It ought not to have
been loose, and there is a bit of discipline for some
jack-tar."</p>

<p>The ship went along as before; and when the passengers
turned out the next morning Manila was in
sight, and not five miles distant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>GOING ON SHORE IN MANILA</h3>


<p>The ship had slowed down in the afternoon, and
reached the entrance of Manila Bay about eight bells,
or four o'clock in the morning. At the Boca Grande
she had taken a pilot; but she still had twenty-five
miles to run. She had come in by the larger of the
two passages, formed by a group of islands, both of
which are called "mouths" (<i>bocas</i>); and the smaller
of them is the Boca Chica. The Blanche had followed
the example of the Guardian-Mother in slowing
down, and had taken a pilot at about the same time.</p>

<p>The passengers had asked the steward on watch in
the cabin to call them at half-past five, and they were
all on deck as soon as it was light enough for them
to see the shore clearly. But the bay is so large that
they could make out the shores only ahead of the
ship. They could see the mountains in the distance,
with a lower stretch of land between them and the
low ground of the shore. All that they could observe
was tropical verdure, with lofty palms on every hand.
The low ground, covered with water in the rainy season,
was planted with rice-fields.</p>

<p>The ladies declared that the view was lovely; and
certainly it presented variety enough, with the high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
lands in the background, and the rich and luxuriant
growth near the bay. The pilot was a Spaniard who
could speak a little English; and the commander
ordered him to bring the ship to anchor at a safe
place, as near as convenient off the end of the two
piers at the mouth of Pasig. The Blanche took a
position abreast of her, off the fort, while the first
was off the lighthouse.</p>

<p>The health-officer came on board, and by this time
it was after sunrise. He was blandly received by
the commander, as every official or visitor was, and
the conversation was carried on in English. All the
ship's company and the passengers were mustered on
the upper deck. The papers, including lists of all
the persons on board, were examined, and compared
with the number presented, which made it clear
that no one was sick in his stateroom or in the forecastle.</p>

<p>The custom-house officers were not far behind, and
the character of the steamer was explained. There
was no manifest, for there was no cargo to be invoiced.
The principal officer was very minute in his
inquiry, and not particularly courteous. He was
evidently impressed by his authority; and the captain
did not invite him to breakfast, as he would have
done if he had been somewhat less conscious of the
magnitude of his office.</p>

<p>The duties on merchandise brought into the islands
were formerly discriminating in favor of Spanish vessels,
which caused other merchantmen to avoid the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
port to its commercial injury; but about twenty years
before a uniform tariff was established, without regard
to the flag under which the ship sailed, and all
export duties were abolished. The official went over
the ship, and the arrangement of her accommodations
ought to have been enough to convince the man that
the vessel was a pleasure yacht. The self-sufficient
officer retreated in good order when he had completed
his examination, leaving a subordinate on board to
see that no merchandise was landed. The latter was
a gentlemanly person, spoke English, and was disposed
to make himself agreeable. He was invited to
breakfast in the cabin.</p>

<p>The passengers had seated themselves on the promenade
during the official examination, observing all
the proceedings, and watching the boats in sight,
some of which were different from anything they had
seen before. They were near enough to the piers to
see some distance up the river. Of course the
Blanche was subjected to the same examination; but
a different set of officials had boarded her, and completed
their work in a much shorter time. It could
be seen that her crew were putting the steam-launch
into the water.</p>

<p>"The Blanchita will be exceedingly serviceable
here," said the commander, who had taken a stand
near the steps of the promenade. "We can go on
shore, and land anywhere we please; for there are
quays all along the river."</p>

<p>"Boat coming down the river with the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
flag at the stern, Captain Ringgold," said Mr. Scott,
saluting the commander.</p>

<p>"Our consul probably," added the captain.
"Would you like to go to a hotel in Manila, ladies?"
asked he.</p>

<p>No one answered the question, but three of them
glanced at Mrs. Belgrave, as though they expected
her to reply; but she made no sign.</p>

<p>"You don't answer, ladies," added the captain.</p>

<p>"We are waiting for Mrs. Belgrave to speak,"
said Mrs. Woolridge.</p>

<p>"I beg you will excuse me," said that lady, laughing.
"I do not know why I am expected to voice
the sentiments of the party."</p>

<p>"Because, like the wife of the President of the
United States at home, you are the first lady on
board," returned the wife of the magnate of the
Fifth Avenue. "Your son is the owner of the
Guardian-Mother, and you are the mother for whom
the ship is named."</p>

<p>"I most respectfully decline to be so regarded;
and if I have ever put on any airs, I will repent
and reform," replied Mrs. Belgrave, laughing all the
while.</p>

<p>"You have never put on airs, or assumed anything
at all," protested Mrs. Woolridge.</p>

<p>"I consider my son a very good boy, and an earnest
advocate of fair play with others," continued
the "first lady" more seriously; and all the party
heartily approved the remark. "Louis found that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the other members of the 'Big Four' were disposed
to rely upon him, and wished to do as he desired.
On the Borneo question he took a secret ballot, and
would not express his own opinion till the vote was
declared, though he voted himself. Every one voted
for himself, and could not have been influenced by
his desire. I propose to follow my son's example.
I wish the commander to be guided by the views of
all rather than mine."</p>

<p>All the passengers, gentlemen included, applauded
her unselfish stand. The lady tore off a blank leaf
from a letter she took from her pocket, and made it
into twelve pieces, which she proceeded to distribute
among the passengers.</p>

<p>"I think the gentlemen are just as much interested
in the question as the ladies; and I invite them to
vote, Mr. Scott included. The question is, Shall we
go to a hotel in Manila, or live on board of the ship,"
said the lady. "You will vote yes or no; yes for
the hotel, and no for the ship."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought to inform you before you vote
that there are at least three hotels in Manila,&mdash;the
Catalana, the Universo, and the Madrid. Of the
merits of each I cannot speak; but we can obtain
correct information before we go to any one of them,
and probably there are more than I have mentioned,"
interposed the commander, very much amused at the
proceedings.</p>

<p>"Please to separate now; and I put you on your
honor to be secret, and not consult any person in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
regard to your vote," Mrs. Belgrave added. "I appoint
Mr. Gaskette to collect, sort, and count the ballots.
After voting, please return to the promenade."</p>

<p>The passengers went individually to various corners,
and wrote their votes. The second officer
collected them in his cap, and then went into the
pilot-house to make out his return. It required but
three minutes to do this, as there was no scattering
votes; and he returned to the promenade.</p>

<p>"Whole number of votes, 12; necessary to a choice,
7; Yes, 2, No, 10, and the No's have carried it," read
Mr. Gaskette, handing the paper to Mrs. Belgrave,
and retiring with a graceful bow.</p>

<p>"Yes means hotel, and no means ship," said the
lady. "Mr. Commander, the party have voted to
live on board of the ship. I am willing to acknowledge
that I cast one of the two yes ballots. But I
am infinitely better satisfied than I should have been
if I had influenced you the other way. I hope you
all consider that the thing has been fairly done."</p>

<p>"Boat coming alongside, sir," reported Mr. Scott
to the captain. "Another boat near, flying the
English flag, headed for the Blanche."</p>

<p>Captain Ringgold hastened to the gangway to receive
the occupant of the boat, whoever he might
prove to be. One of the men on the platform
brought him a card, on which he found the name
of the American consul, who mounted at once to the
deck just as the gong sounded for breakfast.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Webb, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
welcome you to my ship, which is the steam-yacht
Guardian-Mother, on a voyage around the world,"
said the captain, as he grasped the hand of the official.
"Captain Ringgold, at your service."</p>

<p>"I am very happy to meet you, Captain, for I
have heard of you; and I tender my services for any
assistance I may be able to render to you and your
party," replied the consul.</p>

<p>"Now I will introduce you to the ladies and gentlemen
on board, and you will do us the honor to breakfast
with us," added the commander, as he took the
arm of his guest, and conducted him to the promenade,
where he was duly presented to all the passengers
individually.</p>

<p>Louis Belgrave was presented as the owner of the
steamer, for the captain never omitted to give him
a prominent position. The breakfast was the usual
one; but it was always very nice, and Mr. Sage had
hailed a boat, and obtained some very fine fish for
the meal. Mr. Webb was placed on the right of the
commander, Louis's usual place; but he was glad
enough always to get the seat next to Miss Blanche.
The consul was next to Mrs. Belgrave; and he found
her very agreeable, as she never failed to be.</p>

<p>"Now, what are we going to do here, Mr. Commander?"
asked the "first lady," as some had actually
begun to call her already.</p>

<p>"We are going to see the city, of course," he
replied.</p>

<p>"I feel for one as though we had already seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
it, and I can see it all in my mind's eye now," added
the lady. "You and the professor have given us
such a minute account of the place and its surroundings
that it seems to me that I have taken it all in."</p>

<p>"I think most of us have," said Mrs. Woolridge;
and several of the company expressed themselves
to the same effect.</p>

<p>"We have several books in the library about the
city and the islands, and some of us have read them
all," suggested Louis.</p>

<p>"What books have you on board, Mr. Belgrave?"
asked the consul.</p>

<p>"We have 'Twenty Years in the Philippines' by
Monsieur de la Gironi&egrave;re, which some say was written
by Alexandre Dumas, but I don't know about
that; 'Travels in the Philippines,' by F. Jagor, with
an epitome of the work in <i>Harper's Magazine;</i>
and we have Chambers's Encyclop&aelig;dia, Lippincott's
Gazetteer of the present year, and some other
works."</p>

<p>"You seem to be well provided with information,
and with the best extant, unless you consult the
archives of Spain at Madrid," returned the consul.</p>

<p>"The Blanchita is coming alongside, Captain,"
said Mr. Scott, to whom a message to this effect
had been sent down by the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>The breakfast was nearly finished when the word
came; and the party soon went on deck, where they
found all the passengers of the Blanche and the
British consul. The usual hugging and kissing on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the part of the ladies and handshaking by the
gentlemen followed, and the two consuls were duly
presented to all.</p>

<p>"It is time for us to go on shore," said General
Noury, looking at his watch. "The Blanchita is
at the gangway, and I have engaged a pilot for
her. Of course you are all invited to go on shore
in her."</p>

<p>The two consuls volunteered to act as guides; and
the company took their places in the launch, which
was large enough to accommodate double the number.
The pilot took her into the river; and if the ears of
the tourists had been filled full of Manila, there was
plenty for the eyes to take in, and it was not five
minutes after they passed the lighthouse before most
of the passengers were laughing at some of the queer
costumes worn by the people.</p>

<p>They passed a craft which Mr. Webb called a
passage-boat. It was a sort of canoe, manned by
three men, two of them rowing, and one working
a paddle to steer her. Over the after part was an
awning, made of the big leaves of the nipa palm;
and under it were two men and two women, bound
up the river. But a freight-boat interested the young
men most. The hull of it looked more like a canal-boat
than any other craft they could think of. The
planking of the sides extended a little higher up
forward and aft than amidships; and the whole
was covered with an arched roof woven on hoops,
like those of a baggage-wagon, with palm leaves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
The portion at the bow and stern could be removed,
as the whole could. The man at the helm was under
the stern section of the cover, and it was lifted about
a foot to enable him to look ahead.</p>

<p>A wide plank was secured on iron brackets
fastened to each side of the craft, on which were
two men poling the boat up the stream. It was
so far like the mud-scows formerly in use on some of
the waters of New England, except that the men who
worked her with poles walked on the gunwale of the
scow. The boys watched it till it passed out of view
astern. The Blanchita made a landing near the
bridge, on the Binondo side; and all the passengers
went on shore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>EXCURSIONS ON SHORE AND UP THE PASIG</h3>


<p>The Pasig flowed from east to west in the city;
and landing on the north side of the stream, the
tourists soon came to the Escolto, which extended
both ways parallel to the river. It was the principal
street for shoppers and promenaders, and was
exactly what they wished to find, as they had informed
Mr. Webb and Mr. Gollan, the two consuls
who had brought them there.</p>

<p>The avenue was filled at this hour with a motley
variety of people of all the races known in the
islands, from the Tagal Indian up to the native-born
of Spain. Some of them were disposed to
laugh at the strangeness, not to say the absurdity,
of some of the costumes which confronted them;
but all of them were too well bred to indulge their
mirth, or to stare offensively at the subjects of
their suppressed merriment. One young man excited
their attention especially; and Louis at the
side of Miss Blanche, and the rest of the quartet
of young Americans, were also interested.</p>

<p>"He is one of the swells of the city," said Scott,
looking industriously at the clear blue sky.</p>

<p>"He looks like it," replied Louis, as he and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
female companion each gazed with one eye into a shop
window while they fixed the other upon the native,
who was sporting a cane in fantastic twirls, and
evidently believing he was worth looking at.</p>

<p>The subject of their mirth, variously concealed,
was what would be called a colored man at home,
though not a negro; but he was not many removes
in complexion from the original Negrito. He was
toying with a cigar, and wore a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'monocule'">monocle</ins> and a
"stovepipe" hat. His trousers were a sort of plaid;
and his upper works were covered with what looked
like a blouse, though it was really his shirt, with a
linen bosom, secured with studs. At the base of
his figure was a pair of patent-leather shoes, though
he did not affect the luxury of stockings.</p>

<p>The party observed his magnificent movements
till he was out of sight; but their attention was
immediately attracted by a feminine water-carrier,
who was standing on the opposite side of the street.
On her head was a good-sized earthen jar, which
she poised on the summit of her cranium without
support from either hand, one of which she
employed in coquetting with a banana leaf instead
of the national <i>abanico</i>, or fan, of the Spanish
ladies.</p>

<p>"That girl has a very fine form," said Dr. Hawkes,
who was standing near the boys. "She is not a
Spanish maiden, but her complexion is quite as fair
as any of them."</p>

<p>"She has an abundant crop of dark hair, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
she puts it to a good use; for it is braided and
rolled up so that it makes a cushion for the water-jar,"
said Scott.</p>

<p>"She is much taller than the natives we have
been in the habit of seeing," added Louis.</p>

<p>By this time the entire party had halted, and,
taking their cue from the surgeon, were looking at
the water-bearer. The girl had been observing the
strangers before any of them saw her; but as soon
as she realized that she was the object of their
scrutiny, she smiled, and her pretty face lighted
up as though she did not object to being stared at.
Her under garment, with long sleeves, was all the
covering she wore above the belt; and below it her
skirt of uneven length reached just below the knees.
She wore neither shoes nor stockings, and her feet
looked as though they had been "Trilbied."</p>

<p>"I suppose that man over there is carrying
that rooster to market," said Mrs. Belgrave, who
was walking between the commander and Mr.
Webb.</p>

<p>"Not at all, madam; that is a game-bird. The
national amusements of Spain are bull-fighting and
cock-fighting," returned Mr. Webb. "I was in
Madrid one Sunday, and the programme for the
day was a cock-fight at one, a bull-fight at three,
and the Italian opera at six; and I went to all of
them."</p>

<p>"On Sunday?" queried the lady.</p>

<p>"I was there to see the sights, and learn the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
customs of the people; and a bull-fight could be seen
only on Sunday, and the cock-fight was patronized
on that day by the high admiral of the navy. In
Madrid, as in other cities of Continental Europe,
Sunday is not regarded as it is in England and the
United States; and their failure to observe it as we
do is not an evidence that they are irreligious. The
next day was All Saints' or All Souls' Day, I forget
which; and every shop was closed. The noise and
confusion of Sunday and all ordinary days were
silenced. The churches were all open and well
filled, and the people went to the cemeteries to deposit
flowers on the graves of their dead. In Stockholm,
which is a Protestant city, people went to
church in the forenoon; but at one o'clock the band
struck up, and the rest of the day was given up
to frolicking."</p>

<p>"I prefer to live in Von Blonk Park," added Mrs.
Belgrave, with a smile.</p>

<p>"But cock-fighting is vastly more prevalent here
than in Spain, or any other country I have visited.
Wealthy people have their games, and all the poor
people also," continued the consul. "About every
man who can raise money enough to buy one owns
a game-cock, and many take them with them when
they go out.</p>

<p>"Observe that man and woman approaching us;
they are Spanish m&eacute;tis. Both of them wear rather
gay colors. On the other side of the street is a pair
of Chinese m&eacute;tis; and one couple is not much differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>ent
from the other, except, if you are an expert, you
can see something of the high cheek-bones of the
Chinese. Both of the men wear stovepipe hats,
which seems to be the fashion among that class.
Some of them are quite wealthy."</p>

<p>"Do all these different grades fraternize, Mr.
Webb?" asked the commander.</p>

<p>"In business they do, but not socially. The pure
Spaniards look down upon all the native and half-caste
people; and in turn all the other classes do considerable
looking down upon some other grades, till
you get to the Tagals, who are so unfortunate as
to have no other class to look down upon."</p>

<p>The tourists walked along this Broadway of the
city till they were tired, and then turned into a side
street to observe some of the dwelling-houses. The
first thing that they noticed was that most of the
houses were covered on the roof with red tiles, as in
Spain and in other countries. They all had very
small windows, with sliding sashes; and the panes, of
oyster-shells instead of glass, were smaller in proportion
than the windows. Most of them had a balcony
of some sort, which was an out-door sitting-room,
used during leisure hours by the people.</p>

<p>The consuls then conducted the party to a stand
for carriages, and enough of them were engaged to
accommodate all. They were taken for two hours,
with the proviso that the passengers were to be set
down at the landing by the bridge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Natives preparing tobacco in Manila.</span></span><br />
<div class='right'><a href="#Page_285"><i>Page 285.</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>"You must pay in advance," said Mr. Webb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
"That is the custom here. The drivers were cheated
so often in some former time, that it became 'no pay,
no ride.' I bargained at five pesetas an hour for each
vehicle."</p>

<p>The captain, Mrs. Belgrave, and Mr. Webb occupied
the first carriage; and the consul directed the
driver where to go.</p>

<p>"Five pesetas," said the lady when they were
seated. "How much is that?"</p>

<p>"About one dollar. A peseta is the legal unit of
the currency, and is of the same value as the French
franc and the Italian lira, or nineteen cents, three
mills of our money, as estimated by the director of
the United States Mint. The real is a quarter of a
peseta, but the escudo of ten reales has been suppressed.
The Spanish dollar, the same as ours,
though not on a gold standard, is the usual medium
of trade here."</p>

<p>The tourists were driven to the cathedral, the
palaces of the governor and the archbishop, and to
several of the public squares; but they found little
occasion to describe them in their note-books, though
they were all worth looking at. They were taken
through some of the streets occupied by the poorer
classes and to the great cigar factories. Then they
went a little way into one of these, where thousands
of women of all the lower grades of the city were
employed, so that they obtained a good idea of the
establishment.</p>

<p>They were taken to the landing-place as agreed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and embarked immediately in the Blanchita for the
ship, where all were to lunch, feeling that they
had seen all of the city that they wished to visit.
The consuls went with them, but all were tired
enough to rest during the hour given them for the
luncheon. At the expiration of the hour, the commander
remorselessly drove them on board of the
steam-yacht for an excursion up the Pasig to <i>Lago de
Bahia</i>, which is Spanish for Lake of the Bay.</p>

<p>Some of the party were tired; but the captain
declared that they could rest in the little steamer,
and remain seated all the afternoon if they chose.
A skilful pilot for the river and lake had been obtained
by Mr. Gollan, who devoted himself especially
to the pacha and the princess, for they were the
passengers of the English steamer, though he
was very kind and polite to all the company.
Above the bridge the passengers began to open
their eyes, for they had explored the river below
this point.</p>

<p>The captain and Mrs. Belgrave (of course), with
Miss Blanche, Mr. Webb, and the "Big Four," were
all in what had been called the fore cabin in the
Borneo cruises. It was as handsomely and comfortably
fitted up as the after cabin, with an awning
overhead, and curtains at the side, which were regulated
by the relative positions of the boat to the sun.
Two of the English sailors, dressed in their white
uniforms, were on board to adjust these curtains, and
do any other work required of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a dead man on a raft!" exclaimed Mrs.
Belgrave, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>"The man is not so dead as he might be," replied
the consul, laughing. "But the raft is something
worth looking at for you. The affair is simply a
native going to market with his cocoanuts. Ask the
engineer to whistle sharply," he added to one of the
sailors; and it was done.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man on the raft sprang to his feet,
and looked around him. The launch was stopped
to enable the party to see his craft.</p>

<p>"You can see that his boat is a lot of cocoanuts,
a hundred or more, strung together with lines. The
raft easily floats the man, with the current, down
to the city, where he sells his fruit, and then walks
back, or rows in a passage-boat for his fare," Mr.
Webb explained forward, and Mr. Gollan aft.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a little village where half
a dozen dark-colored girls, with their long hair dragging
in the water, were swimming in a small bay
at the side of the stream like so many nymphs. It
was an aquatic frolic, and the Naiads were enjoying
themselves to their hearts' content. By the riverside
was a house on stilts, with an open door, from
which the tourists saw two girls dive into the stream,
and swim away as though the water were their natural
element. They cut up all sorts of capers, to the
great amusement of the party; and then two of them
swam to the launch, and held out their hands. They
received a couple of pesetas each from the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and the pacha. Then all the rest of them followed
their example, and were rewarded in like manner.</p>

<p>The Blanchita resumed her course up the river
at her usual speed; and the voyagers found enough to
interest them, and enough in the explanations of the
consuls to instruct them. The boat rushed by the
barges and passage-boats as though they were at
anchor. The villages and the houses reminded them
of those they had seen on the Menam in the vicinity
of Bangkok.</p>

<p>"Do you notice the horned cattle?" asked Mr.
Webb. "They call them buffaloes here."</p>

<p>"They are what we should call broad-horns at
home," replied the captain. "I never saw any such
wide-spreading and long horns as I see here."</p>

<p>"I am told that you have a quartet of Nimrods
in your company; and I am sure they would find
plenty of sport in the country beyond the lake, where
the wild buffalo is to be found in herds as on our
Western prairies formerly. But they are a dangerous
beast to hunt; for they will fight like tigers, and not
a few hunters have been killed by them."</p>

<p>"We should like to try them; and with rifles good
for nine shots, I think we could take care of ourselves,"
replied Louis.</p>

<p>They found plenty of buffaloes on the shores of
the river, but they were as tame as doves. At one
place on the bank they saw a naked boy of ten fooling
with one of them, jumping over him, and being
dragged by his tail. It was but a short trip to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
lake for the Blanchita, and the party sailed all
around it. They were all delighted with the excursion;
and the launch was hurried down the river,
and reached the Blanche, where they were to dine
at seven o'clock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>HALF A LECTURE ON CHINESE SUBJECTS</h3>


<p>The dinner on board of the Blanche was fully
up to the standard of the epicureans on board of
both steamers; for the cooks of both had been busy
all day, and the consuls declared that it was fully
equal to the best of which they had partaken in
London or Paris. As it was to be the last time
the tourists were to meet these excellent and accomplished
officials, the occasion was a very jolly affair.
Speeches were made by both of them, in which they
were lavish in praise of both the dinner and the
elegant accommodations of both the steamers.</p>

<p>Captain Ringgold replied, returning the most
hearty thanks to both of the official gentlemen for
their kindness in acting as the guides of the travellers,
and for the interesting and valuable information
they had given them. Both of them had
declared that the company ought to remain in
Manila at least a week; but the commander pleaded
the long voyage still before the ships, and repeated
what he had so often said before, that, in
such a long cruise as they were taking, it was quite
impossible to do anything more than obtain a specimen
of each country or island they visited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>When they left the table the consuls took leave
individually of each of the passengers, and were
sent on shore in the barge of the Blanche, for the
steam-launch had already been taken upon the deck
of the ship. During the day both steamers had
taken in a supply of coal, and the chief stewards
had procured stores of provisions, ice, and especially
fruit. As the party were taking leave of the two
agreeable gentlemen, they heard the hissing of steam
on the Blanche, which they did not quite understand,
as the commander or Captain Sharp "had
made no sign." The Guardian-Mother's people were
taken on board, after another leave-taking, and conveyed
to their ship in their own boats.</p>

<p>"What is going on, Captain Ringgold?" asked
Mrs. Belgrave, when she heard the hissing steam
on board of the Guardian-Mother.</p>

<p>"Going on to Hong-Kong," replied the commander.</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"To-night."</p>

<p>"But we have been here only one day," suggested
the "first lady."</p>

<p>"The anchor is hove short; but if you think of
anything more that you wish to see in Manila or
its vicinity, I will remain," added the captain.</p>

<p>"I don't know that there is anything more to
be seen. I seemed to know the city before I had
seen it."</p>

<p>"Very well, then we will go to sea to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>By ten o'clock the ships were under way; and in
a couple of hours more they were in the China
Sea, headed north-west-by-north, for Hong-Kong.
The sea was as smooth as glass, for the east monsoon
seemed to be interrupted under the lee of the
islands. The passengers retired at an early hour,
and there was no excuse for not going to sleep at
once.</p>

<p>In the morning the ship was a long way out of
sight of land. Breakfast had been ordered for an
hour later than usual, in order to let the party sleep
off the fatigue of the day before. But some of
them were on deck at sunrise, and saw the beautiful
phenomenon of that orb coming out of the eastern
sea. There was not an island or anything else in
sight but the broad expanse of water. The air was
delightful; and it was not hot in the early morning,
and under the awnings it would not be during the
day. A gentle sea gave the ship a little motion,
but it was a quiet time.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served at the appointed hour; and
at this time Mr. Gaskette was busy with his assistants,
arranging the frame for a new map, considerably
larger than any used before, at the head of
Conference Hall. He had been at work upon it
for several days, and he intended that it should
surpass anything he had done before. The orang-outang,
the monkey, and the pheasant had been
removed to the library, where there was plenty of
room for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>China was a great country, and the professor
thought it would require a long talk to dispose of
it; and the conference was called for ten o'clock,
and so announced at breakfast time. When the
passengers went on deck, the first thing that attracted
their attention was the new map; and considering
that it was made on board of the ship, it
was a beautiful piece of work, for the second officer
was an artist. At the appointed hour they were
all in their seats.</p>

<p>This map, though correct at the time it was
made, did not, of course, include the changes which
resulted from the war between Japan and China,
and which have not even yet been incorporated in
modern history. The pacha had been invited to
give the lecture on China; but he declared that it
was too difficult a subject for him to undertake,
and he begged to be excused, and Professor Giroud
had willingly undertaken it. It had required all
his time on the voyage from Saigon, and all his
spare time at Manila, to prepare himself for the
difficult task. With the three siamangs in their
usual places, he mounted the platform.</p>

<p>A signal from the Blanche caused him to resume his
seat, and the screw was stopped. The barge from
the consort dropped into the water; and the general,
his wife, the rajah, Mrs. Sharp, and Dr. Henderson
came on board, and chairs were provided
for them. Miss Blanche gave up the baby to Mrs.
Noury, who was very fond of the little creature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
The professor then took his place again on the rostrum,
with the pointer in his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Commander, ladies and gentlemen," he
began. "Before I say a word, I desire to acknowledge
my very great obligations to Mr. Gaskette for
the elegant map he has prepared and placed before
us. You observe that it extends from the Amur
River,&mdash;which is spelled in older books Amoor; but
the latest fashion is to make it Amur, as Hindu and
similar words have been changed from oo to u, for
both have the same sound in most European and
Oriental names,&mdash;from the Amur River to Tonquin,
about thirty degrees of latitude, with the nineteen
provinces of China, with Korea, properly spelled
with initial K, with the islands of Formosa and
Hainan. It has given the artist a great deal of labor,
and he has done his work in a manner to call for your
highest commendation."</p>

<p>The audience vigorously applauded this statement;
and the siamangs added their "Ra! Ra! Ra!" with
a volley of squeaks. Mr. Gaskette bowed his acknowledgments;
and the professor handed him the
pointer, which looked like a new arrangement.</p>

<p>"The artist is as well or better acquainted with
the map than I am, and I have invited him to assist
on the platform. Manchuria, and I adopt the most
modern spelling of the name," continued the professor,
as the artist pointed to the province.</p>

<p>"I thought the subject for to-day was China," interposed
Mrs. Belgrave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"So it is, madam; but the modern history of China
begins with Manchuria. On the west of it is Mongolia,
which any of the old-fashioned gentlemen may
call Chinese Tartary if they prefer, though that
designation is not in use now. Manchuria is a province
of China; though the latter was a province of
the former three hundred and fifty years ago, for
then it conquered China, whose present emperor is
the descendant of the conquering Manchu monarch.
Manchuria has an area of 280,000, and a population
of 21,000,000; but not more than one million of the
people are Manchus, who wear the costume and
speak the language of the Chinese. The rest of the
people are emigrants from China or other countries,
and are as industrious and prosperous as any other in
the vast empire.</p>

<p>"The Manchus are the aristocracy of the country;
and ever since they gave China its ruler, their
country has been the principal territory for recruiting
the Celestial armies; and there are said to be
80,000 of their soldiers in service. And they also
furnish China with its magistrates and police. But
I will leave their country to take its place with the
other provinces of the empire. China is believed
by its own chronologists to have been in existence
2637 years before the Christian era, and perhaps
from a date still farther back; but these dates are
doubtful.</p>

<p>"The people of China do not know their country
by the name so familiar to us, or they know it only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
so far as they have learned it from merchants and
travellers. In the matter of names they all seem
barbarous to us; I do not attempt to pronounce
them; and I don't think you will succeed in doing so
any better than I have. I may add that I have never
been in China; and what I tell you I did not pick up
myself, but must derive it from others who have
travelled and lived in the country.</p>

<p>"I have obtained nearly all my information from
the very learned and valuable article of Dr. Legge,
in Chambers's. He is familiar with the language of
the Chinese, has travelled and lived in the country,
and is fully acquainted with the manners and customs
of the people. In the oldest literature of the
empire, it is called <i>Hw&acirc; Hsi&acirc;</i>, the first word meaning
'flowery,' and the second is the proper name of the
country. Chung Kwo is the Middle Kingdom, which
came into being in the feudal period, in the midst of
the several states and tribes; and if you wish to
know more of China, there is an American edition
of Dr. Williams in four volumes, which will tell you
all about it. But the name did not mean the middle
of the earth, as sometimes claimed, nor is it the
foundation of the derisive term applied to China,
'The Central Flowery Nation.'</p>

<p>"Other names have been given to China, though
seldom seen or heard; but Cathay, perhaps coming
from the Russian name Kitai, is not at all uncommon,
especially in poetry. The name we use comes
to us from India, when two Buddhist missionaries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
who came from 'the land of Chin,' called it China
and Chintan.</p>

<p>"As stated before, the native Chinese line of rulers,
the Ming dynasty, conquered China in 1644, and
placed the first of the Tsing monarchs on the throne.
I will not tangle up your intellects by following out
the individuals of the succession any farther than to
say that the present emperor, or Hwangti, of China
is Tsait'ien, who was proclaimed as such in January,
1875. The ruler may name his successor, for the
descent is not hereditary to his eldest son; and if
he fails to do so, the default is made good by his
family. He is the ninth emperor of the Manchu or
Tartar dynasty.</p>

<p>"As I said, China has nineteen provinces, including
the island of Formosa, all of which are represented
on the map before you. The divisions of the
country are immensely populous; though the average
of the whole to the square mile is less than that of
Belgium by nearly one-half, several of whose provinces
are more densely peopled than any in China.
It is also less than the State of Rhode Island, and
but a little above that of Massachusetts,&mdash;the two
States the most densely inhabited in our own country.</p>

<p>"Many say that the population of China has been
exaggerated; and it is variously given at from 282,000,000
to 413,000,000, a very great difference, and
you suit yourselves with the figures if you can.
Dr. Legge thinks that 400,000,000 is not an over-estimate.
The area of the eighteen provinces is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
1,336,841 square miles, to which about 15,000 may
be added for Formosa; but the area of the whole
Chinese empire is 4,218,401, while that of the United
States, including Alaska, is 3,501,409.</p>

<p>"If you look at the map, you will see that there
are numerous chains of mountains in the countries
lying west of China, especially in Tibet, while China
proper has but few of them. The land generally
slopes from the several ranges to the sea, but I
will not perplex you with the names of them. The
rivers, of course, flow from the mountains, and you
can see that they have space for a long course.
They are generally called <i>ho</i> in the north, and <i>chiang</i>
or <i>kiang</i> in the south. The Ho, Hoang-ho, or
Yellow River, and the Chiang, known to us as the
Yang-tsze-Chiang, must be over three thousand miles
long. I will not follow them from source to mouth.
Canton, or <i>Choo-Chiang</i> River, which means Pearl
River, is also a very large stream. All these waterways,
you notice on the map, have a general course
from west to east. All of them are navigable, though
the Hoang-ho is less so than the Yang-tsze-Chiang,
the 'most beloved' of the Chinese; for its counterpart
in the north is a turbid stream, so tricky that it
changed its course in 1853 so that its mouth is now
about two hundred and fifty miles north of where
it was before that date."</p>

<p>Mr. Gaskette pointed out the former course, which
he had indicated by double dotted lines, and that
of the present course to the Gulf of Pe-chi-li.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Chinese history begins twenty-four hundred years
before our era, when the first human kings of Egypt
were on the throne, with the narrative of a tremendous
inundation, which some have identified as that
of the Flood in the Old Testament. But the floods
did not cease with that event, for several others
have followed. As late as 1887, only half a dozen
years ago, the treacherous Hoang-ho broke loose, and
poured its waters into the populous province of Honan,
tearing everything to pieces and destroying millions
of lives. There have been so many of these
floods that they have given the great river the name
of 'China's Sorrow.' But the Manchu rulers are
repairing damages, and providing against such disasters
in the future.</p>

<p>"I have to speak next about the Grand Canal and
the Great Wall; but I will defer it for half an hour
for a recess, for I think you must be tired of the dry
details I have been giving you," said the professor,
as he stepped down from the rostrum.</p>

<p>The company then promenaded the deck for the
time indicated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>THE CONTINUATION OF THE LECTURE</h3>


<p>A walk of half an hour had freshened up the
minds and bodies of the passengers, and they took
their places on the promenade for the continuation
of the lecture. The professor had been to his stateroom,
and returned with additional notes.</p>

<p>"Dr. Legge quotes Marco Polo, the greatest traveller
of the Middle Ages, who visited China in the
thirteenth century," the speaker began, taking a
paper from the table, and reading as follows in
regard to the Grand Canal: "'Kubl&acirc;i caused a water
communication to be made in the shape of a wide
and deep channel dug between stream and stream,
between lake and lake, forming as it were a great
river on which large vessels can ply.' Kubl&acirc;i was
the first sovereign of one of the old dynasties.</p>

<p>"The canal extended from Peking, the capital,
in the north, to the south of the empire, a distance
of six hundred miles; and it was in use all the way
in former times. The Chinese were not distinguished
as navigators; but in modern times steamers ply
between Canton and the ports of the Gulf of Pe-chi-li,
so that the canal is less necessary, and much
of it is in bad condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Great Wall is better known to all the
world than the Grand Canal as a peculiarly Chinese
wonder, and every school boy and girl has heard of
it. It was built as a defence against the raids of
the northern tribes, though for this purpose it was
a failure; but it still stands, though some of the
English newspapers only a few years ago treated
it as a myth; yet there is no doubt whatever of its
existence, for it has been visited by many reliable
English and American travellers. It was begun
two hundred and fourteen years before the Christian
era.</p>

<p>"Our artist has indicated the wall on the map;"
and Mr. Gaskette pointed it out on the west shore
of the Gulf of Liau-tung, properly a part of the
Gulf of Pe-chi-li, and traced it some distance to
the west. "Its length, following its numerous twists
and bends, through valleys and over mountains, is
fifteen hundred miles. It is twenty-five feet wide
at the base, and fifteen at the top. It is formed by
two walls of brick, different from those we use,
weighing from forty to sixty pounds; and the space
between them is filled with earth and stones. It
varies in height from fifteen to thirty feet.</p>

<p>"The top of the wall is paved with brick, but
is now overgrown with grass. Along the wall, and
not on it, are towers of brick at intervals. You
observe that at Peking the wall makes a sweep to
the north, perhaps thirty miles or more, enclosing
a square of land of this extent outside of the general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
course of the structure. I met an American gentleman
who had been to the capital of China, and he
told me he had been to the Great Wall. Dr. Legge
may take the conceit out of some travellers when
he says: 'What foreigners go to visit from Peking
is merely a loop-wall of later formation, enclosing
portions of Chih-li and Shan-hs&icirc;.'</p>

<p>"Leaving the Grand Canal and the Great Wall,
we will pass on to the lakes of China. They are
not on a large scale, like the rivers; and they are
insignificant compared with those of our own country.
The Tung-ting H&ucirc; appears to be the largest, mostly
in the province of Hunan, which is sixty-five or
seventy miles long. The others are Po-yang H&ucirc;,
in Chiang-hs&icirc;, and the Tai H&ucirc;, which is noted for
its romantic scenery and numerous islets.</p>

<p>"The temperature of the various provinces is on
the average lower than any other country in the
same latitude. There is every variety of climate
in the vast territory of China. The natives consider
the three southern provinces, including the island
of Hainan, less healthy than the other portions of
the country; but foreigners find no difficulty in residing
in them. In a region taking in over twenty
degrees of latitude, the productions vary from those
of the tropics to those in the latitude of central
New York, from bananas and pineapples in the south
to wheat and Indian corn in the north.</p>

<p>"About all the common grains are raised in the
north, and rice is the staple product of the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
All sorts of vegetables and herbs, ginger, and various
condiments, are produced and largely used; though
I believe the people are not so hot, gastronomically,
in their taste as we found them in Batavia and some
other places in the islands. They raise the cane
and make sugar in Formosa and the southern provinces.
All the fruits of our own country, including
Florida and Louisiana, are grown in different parts
of China. Opium, which formerly came into the
country only from India, is now produced even in
Manchuria.</p>

<p>"The Chinese are pre-eminently agriculturists, and
farming is their occupation above anything else. In
the spring the emperor turns over a few furrows in
a sacred field, introducing the work of the season;
and the chief official in every province does the same,
keeping the importance of farming pursuits always
before the people. The tools they use are very
primitive; the hoe being the principal hand-tool, and
the plough of ancient use for animal power. There
is an extensive application of irrigation, which is
found to be so necessary in some of our extreme
Western States. In the north wells are used; and
various simple machinery is employed to raise water
when the canal or river is below the level of the field
where it is needed, which you may have an opportunity
to see.</p>

<p>"No kind of fertilizer is wasted, and some are
used which are often neglected in other countries.
A great deal of fun and sarcasm is applied to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
food of the Chinese, but most of us rather approved
the dishes set before us by our host of the Flowery
Nation in Singapore. In some articles used for culinary
purposes, Parisians go beyond the Chinese, as
in the use of horse-beef. I have been in a provision
store in Paris where nothing else was sold; and every
part of the animal was economized, including the liver,
kidneys, and tongue, and sausages of this meat were
on view and for sale to epicures in this flesh. But I
believe the Chinese do not eat the horse, unless it be
in a season of famine; and they had to eat cats in
Paris during the siege of 1870.</p>

<p>"When you go into the markets you may see
whole dogs dressed for food, or cut up into pieces
ready for cooking. These are not common yellow
dogs, such as you saw in the capital of the Turkish
empire; but they are the peculiar Chinese breed,
sleek and hairless, which are carefully fatted, and
prepared for market. I have no doubt that your
stomachs revolt at the very idea of eating dog; but
I cannot see that it is any worse than eating pork
and fowls, which feed more or less on animal food.
However, I do not hanker after dog-meat.</p>

<p>"The Buddhist religion prevails to a great extent
here, which diminishes the quantity of beef used,
though not so much as the kindly feeling towards
the creature that is so useful in tilling the soil.
Pork is the most common in use for meat, and the
number of pigs raised is enormous. Geese and ducks
are abundant, artificially hatched as in ancient Egypt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and to a considerable extent in America, and are
largely used for food.</p>

<p>"The sea, rivers, and lakes supply fish in all
needed quantities. They are taken in nets, and
also by a novel method of fishing with which you
cannot be familiar. A boat goes out with a number
of cormorants trained for the purpose, which are
fishers by nature. The birds dive and bring up
the fish, which they deposit in the hand-nets of the
boatman.</p>

<p>"Dr. Legge says the Chinese are not gross feeders,
as generally represented, except the very poor,
and that a Chinese dinner of twenty-seven courses
'may hold its own with the most luxurious tables.'
He adds that the famous bird's-nest soup is a misnomer;
but he admits that nests from the Indian
Archipelago are sliced into other soups, in his opinion
without improving the flavor.</p>

<p>"For a drink, tea has superseded every other beverage,
and is taken without sugar or milk. It was
not used at all in ancient times, but its use is universal
at the present time. The plant is not grown in
the north. Black tea comes from the central provinces,
and green from two eastern mainly. Next to
silk, if not equal to it, tea is the principal article
of export. The doctor says that tea-drinking promotes
the temperance of the people more than any
other influence. Alcoholic liquors are distilled from
rice and millet.</p>

<p>"From the twelfth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the literature of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the nation abounds in temperance lectures, warning
the people against the injury of strong drinks; but
tea has done vastly more to prevent their use than
anything else. As a people at home the Chinese
make little use of liquors, though that is not always
the case with those who live in New York. They
do not sit down to tea as we do, but keep it at hand
at all times, and treat their visitors with it. Tea is
written in the vernacular of the natives <i>ch'&acirc;</i>. When
it was first imported into England it was called <i>t'ay;</i>
but those who gave it the name were doubtless Irishmen,
and they still stick to it.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that silk was first produced
in China; and silk, linen, and cotton form the clothing
of the people. A ceremony like that with the
plough is performed by the emperor over the silkworms
and mulberry-trees, whose leaves are the
food of the worm. From before the twenty-third
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the care of the silkworm, and the spinning
and weaving of the thread from the cocoon, has
been the particular labor of the women. The mulberry-tree
grows everywhere in the country, and silk
is manufactured in greater or less quantities in every
province.</p>

<p>"The cotton-plant has been propagated in China;
and the cloth is largely used there, though not equal
in finish to the imported article, but is heavier and
more lasting in wear. Nankeen comes from Nanking.
There are no fireplaces in the houses; and the
people keep warm, if they can, by increasing their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
clothing. Woollen goods are not manufactured to
any great extent.</p>

<p>"I will not describe the pagodas, pavilions, bridges,
and palaces; for you will see them for yourselves.
The streets of the cities in the south and some in
the north are no better than mere lanes; and the
crowds of people hustling through them fill them
about full, and make you think the place is vastly
more populous than it really is. As a set-off to this
idea, you will wonder what has become of the women,
for you rarely meet any of them.</p>

<p>"The streets are paved with stone slabs, badly
drained, and abounding in bad odors, and you are
not likely to enjoy your walks through them; but
they have magnificent names, which you will not
read at the corners, such as the street of Benevolence,
Righteousness, etc. When you go into the
house of a tolerably well-to-do family, you will find
the quantity of furniture rather scanty, and not luxurious.
The floor may be covered with matting, but
you will find no carpets or rugs. A table and some
straight-backed chairs are the principal pieces. On
the walls you may find Chinese pictures, which will
not challenge your admiration, though they may be
artistic in China. Some jars and specimens of fine
porcelain may adorn the room, with writings on the
walls expressing moral sentiments. There may be
a couch, or more of them, of bamboo and rattan.</p>

<p>"The bamboo is quite as important a production in
China as we have found it in India and the islands;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and it is used for all the purposes here, and more
in addition than have been mentioned to you before.
The bastinado of the magistrate and the schoolmaster's
instrument of torture are both bamboos.</p>

<p>"Our Nimrods would not find much sport here;
for the country is too densely populated to afford
hiding-places for wild animals, though a bear or a
tiger may sometimes appear, and is quickly killed.
There are elephants, rhinoceroses, and tapirs in the
forests of Yun-nan; and the emperor has tame elephants
at Peking for state purposes. The brown
and the black bear are found in certain localities, as
well as varieties of deer.</p>

<p>"The domestic four-footed animals are small horses
and small cattle, which have not been improved.
The donkey is a livelier beast than in England or
America. About the capital there are very fine
mules, which are fashionable there as they are in
some parts of Spain. Birds of prey are common,
and magpies are sacred birds which the Nimrods
must not shoot. The people are very fond of song-birds
and flowers, which proves their good taste.</p>

<p>"There are vast quantities of minerals beneath the
soil of the country, yet little had been done in mining;
though, since the government has steamers of its
own, they are doing more to develop the mines. The
currency of the country is nowhere; for the only coin
that is legally current is the copper <i>cash</i>, of which it
takes ten to make our cent. Large payments are
made in silver by weight, and the housekeeper has to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
keep a pair of scales handy to ascertain the value of
the silver she receives or expends.</p>

<p>"But I know, my friends, that I have wearied you;
and though I have something more to say about this
very interesting country, I shall defer it till such
time as the commander shall appoint."</p>

<p>The professor bowed and retired; but, as an offset
to his last remark, the applause was more prolonged
and vigorous than usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>THE CONCLUSION OF THE LECTURE</h3>


<p>At lunch the passengers talked about the lecture
that was not yet finished; and all of them who said
anything declared that they were very much pleased
with it, and they hoped the remainder of it would be
given in the afternoon. Of course all of them had
read more or less about China; and while there was
much that was new to them, they were glad to have
their knowledge of the country revived.</p>

<p>"I have been in Hong-Kong, Canton, and Shang-hai,
and I have heard no lecture on board that
pleased me more than that to which we listened this
forenoon; and I appoint this afternoon at three
o'clock for the conclusion of it," said the commander.</p>

<p>At this hour all the company, including the passengers
from the Blanche, were in their places; and
the speaker mounted the rostrum, apparently as
fresh as ever. He was received with as much and as
earnest applause as had been given at the end of the
second part of his lecture; and with this pleasant
approval of his work, he continued his discourse.</p>

<p>"According to the accounts of all recent travellers,
the roads of China are in a villanously bad condition,
and there are no railroads worth mentioning,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
he began. "And yet the necessity of good common
roads was apparent to the ruler, even before the
building of the Great Wall, and twenty thousand
of them have been constructed; but the Chinese,
having finished a great work, do not meddle with
it again. The roads have never been repaired
thoroughly, and that accounts for their present condition.
The rivers and canals furnish the principal
means of communication, though the roads are still
used.</p>

<p>"The dress of the poorer classes is very much
the same for both sexes. It is regulated by sumptuary
laws for all classes; but it is varied by the
wealthy in the use of costly material, and the ornaments
they add to it. You have all seen Chinamen
enough in the streets of New York and other cities,
and the dress they wear is about the same as that
worn in their native land. The queue is the most
notable thing about them. This was not the ancient
custom of wearing the hair, but was introduced and
enforced by the Manchu rulers over three hundred
years ago, when it was considered a degrading edict;
though now the Chinaman sticks to his queue with
as much tenacity as he does to his very life.</p>

<p>"The small feet of the women, even of the highest
class, is quite as notable as the queues. This species
of deformity was not required by the Manchus, for
they wore their feet as God gave them; and it is
not an ancient custom, for it has prevailed only
from the sixth century of our era. Nature's growth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
is checked by tightly bandaging the feet in early
childhood, subjecting the victim to severe pain and
discomfort. But you will see the women for yourselves,
and can judge of the effect upon them. The
very poor and those in menial conditions are not
necessarily subjected to the torture, but fashion carries
even many of this class into the custom. Small
but natural feet are the pride of our young ladies,
and some of them complain that when the feet were
given out they got more than their share.</p>

<p>"The sexes are kept apart until marriage; and
this has been a social feature from the earliest time.
Girls and boys in the family did not occupy the
same mat or eat together from the age of seven,
and when the former were ten they ceased to appear
outside of the women's apartments. Girls were
taught manners therein, to handle the cocoons, to
do all the work appertaining to the manufacture
of silk and the details of Chinese housekeeping.
This was in the feudal time; and the females were
not instructed in book-learning, and are not now,
though they pick up something of an education, and
learned women are not unknown, even those who
have written books.</p>

<p>"In regard to marriage, the parents have entire
control, and professional match-makers are an institution.
It is to a great extent a matter of horoscopes.
Usually the bride and groom have not seen
each other till the marriage ceremony, and of course
they lose all that delightful period which precedes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the event. But they appear to take to each other
when brought together, and to be happy as man and
wife. Though the man has one legal wife, there is
no law or custom to prevent him from taking half
a dozen more secondary wives.</p>

<p>"There are seven lawful grounds for divorcing a
wife from her husband,&mdash;disobedience to her husband's
parents; failure to give birth to a son; dissolute
conduct; jealousy of her man, especially in
regard to the <i>other</i> wives; talkativeness; thieving;
and leprosy. I will leave the ladies to make their
own comments. There are three considerations
which may set aside these reasons for divorce,&mdash;that
her parents are no longer living; that she has
passed with her spouse through the years of mourning
for his parents; and that he has become rich
after being poor. The children are often affianced
in childhood, and probably this fact furnishes many
of the grounds for proceedings in the divorce court.</p>

<p>"Infanticide is not an uncommon crime in China,
female children being almost always the victims.
Probably its prevalence is somewhat exaggerated.
It is among the poorest class that this atrocity prevails,
the universal desire for male children, in connection
with the ancestral worship of the people,
being the root of the evil. Public opinion is against
the practice, though not as decidedly as might be
wished.</p>

<p>"The complexion of the Chinese is yellowish, as
you have seen in our streets; and from the extreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
north to the Island of Hainan, they all have long
black hair, almond or oblique eyes, high cheek-bones,
and round faces. They are greatly addicted to
opium and gambling wherever you find them. Dr.
Legge says that the longer one lives among them
the better he likes them, and the better he thinks
of them; but we are not likely to be able to test
the correctness of this remark.</p>

<p>"The Chinese bury their dead in graves in the
form of a horseshoe, and with an almost infinite
variety of ceremonies and sacrifices. Where the
friends are able to pay the expense, the last rites
are ostentatious and very costly. You may chance
to see something of them before you leave the country.
When a very rich Chinaman travels, he takes
his coffin with him.</p>

<p>"They have no day in the week corresponding
to our Sunday, but they have an annual universal
holiday at New Year's. It is a season of rejoicing
and festivity all over the country. Stores are closed
for several days, and the government offices are shut
up for a month. The people 'dress up,' and the
temples are visited, the gambling resorts are in full
blast, and crackers and other fireworks make Fourth
of July of the season.</p>

<p>"There is some sort of a festival every month,
such as the 'Feast of Lanterns,' on the full moon,
of the tombs, 'Dragon Boats,' and 'All Souls,' in
honor of departed relatives, when the supposed hungry
spirits from the other side of the Styx are fed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
at the cemeteries. The people are extravagantly
fond of theatricals; and a kind of bamboo tent is
erected for the performance, which is usually of
inordinate length. Females, as in India, do not
appear on the stage.</p>

<p>"It would be quite impossible for me to follow
the consecutive history of China from 2637 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
down to the present time; it would be an infliction
upon you, and I shall only mention some of
the principal events. Our authority in these remarks
numbers the Chinese army at three hundred
and fifty thousand; the Year Book makes it double
this number. Judged by a European standard, it
does not amount to much outside of mere numbers;
though in addition to it there is a sort of militia,
camped in the several provinces, more in the nature
of police than soldiers, of twice as many men as
the imperial army.</p>

<p>"The first great war in China was the T&acirc;i-Ping
rebellion, which the older of you can remember. It
began in 1851, and was continued for nearly twenty
years. Its leader was Hung, a poor student, who
studied up a new religion, which was certainly an
improvement upon those of the people, for it recognized
the Great God, and Christ as the Elder Brother.
A strict morality and the keeping of the Sabbath
were required of its adherents, and idolatry and the
use of opium were forbidden.</p>

<p>"Hung incited the rebellion; and its object was to
overturn the ruling dynasty of the Manchus, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
place himself on the throne. It was at first very
successful in its progress, and it looked as though
the imperial cause was doomed. In 1855 the rebels,
for the want of sufficient re-enforcements in an attempt
to capture Pekin, were compelled to retreat
to Nanking, and then the decline of the insurrection
began. A body of foreigners under an American by
the name of Ward joined the imperialists, and rendered
important service; but he was killed in battle
in 1862. He was succeeded by one of the subordinates,
who became General Burgevine; and he was
quite as successful as General Ward had been. The
new general fell out with the government, and retired.
By the influence of British residents at Shang-hai,
who had organized an effective army, General
Charles George Gordon, of whom you heard in Egypt,
was placed in command. He captured Nanking, and
the rebellion was suppressed in 1865.</p>

<p>"You have been informed of the movements of
the Portuguese, English, French, Dutch, and Spaniards
to obtain territory in the East from 1497, when
Vasco da Gama doubled the Cape of Good Hope.
All of them established colonies; and in 1516 they
began to send their ships to China, whose people
did not receive them kindly. This was in the early
days of the Manchu rulers, who claimed to be superior
to all other monarchs on the face of the earth;
they would not acknowledge the visitors as their
equals, and regarded them as vassals.</p>

<p>"When the Chinese ruler learned of the conquests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of those from the West he tried to prevent their
approach to his dominions. But trade had been established;
and the opium traffic had its birth, and
the people were crazy to procure and smoke it. This
was the cause of the wars between China and England
and France, with the vassal question. In 1800
an edict of the emperor prohibited the importation
of opium into his dominions.</p>

<p>"England before this had entered upon the task
of making a treaty to settle the relations between
the two countries; but no treaty was made, and the
smuggling of opium continued for many years. In
1816 another embassy went to Pekin; but it was
summarily and contemptuously dismissed because the
ambassador refused to go through the ceremony of
repeatedly prostrating himself before the emperor,
and acknowledging his own sovereign as a vassal of
the emperor.</p>

<p>"The trade went on after India passed to the
government of England. China was still obstinate,
insisted upon the vassalship of the Western nation,
and was confident in her power to repress the opium
trade. The merchants pressed vigorously for the
enlargement of their trade with China, which did not
seem to be aware of its weakness before a European
power. A famous mandarin was appointed governor-general
of the Kwang provinces to bring the barbarians
to their senses. He proceeded in earnest,
and England declared war against the country in
1840. The result was evident from the first, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the war ended with the peace of Nanking in 1842.
The items were the ceding of Hong-Kong to the
victor, the opening of five ports to the trade and residence
of the British. Correspondence was established
between the officials of the two nations; but not a
word was said about opium, and the smuggling went
on as before.</p>

<p>"In 1857, after some troubles in Canton in which
the English were at fault, and the refusal of the
governor-general to meet an agent of the British government,
the latter declared war again, with France
as an ally. Canton was captured the same year; and
Yeh, the governor, was taken prisoner, and sent to
Calcutta. There was little fighting in this war; and
Canton being in possession of the allies, a joint commission,
attended by representatives of the United
States and Russia, proceeded to Pekin to make their
demands upon the emperor. A treaty was made at
Tien-tsin, confirming the former, and with many important
articles. One provided for the appointment
of ambassadors by each nation, another for the protection
of Christian missionaries, and several others
of less moment.</p>

<p>"It looked as though the Chinese emperor had
been sufficiently humiliated; but the treaty 'slipped
up,' for its last clause provided that the treaty should
be ratified at Pekin within one year. The emperor
could not abide the idea of permitting the ambassadors
to enter the sacred capital, and he looked about
him for the means of escaping the issue. The forts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
between the capital and the Gulf of Pe-chi-li had
been rebuilt and were well armed. The Chinese
officials urged the signing at Tien-tsin, and this
was done by several of the embassy; but France
and England insisted that it must be signed in
Pekin, as provided in the instrument itself.</p>

<p>"They started for the sacred city with several
men-of-war, but they found the mouth of the river
closed to them by the forts. A severe engagement
followed, in which the allies were beaten, the only
battle gained by the Chinese. At the end of a year
another expedition with twenty thousand men went
with the ambassadors, the forts were all taken, and
the officials went to Tien-tsin. The force marched
on Pekin; and the emperor fled, leaving his brother
Prince Kung to meet the embassy. The north-east
gate of the city was surrendered, and the treaty
was duly signed at Pekin.</p>

<p>"In 1861 the emperor died, having named his
son, six years old, as his successor. A dozen years
later he took possession of the throne, the regency
expiring then. He died two years later, and a
nephew of Prince Kung was appointed to the succession
by the imperial family. He was a child of
four years of age then, and reigned under a regency
till 1887, when he took possession of the government
at the age of sixteen.</p>

<p>"I should have said before that a change of the
tariff in 1842 made the importation of opium legal
in the empire. The country has in recent years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
employed foreign officers in its army and navy,
and foreign mechanics in its workshops. China is
represented at five of the principal nations of the
world by ambassadors. It has built up a very respectable
navy, mostly at the shipyards of Great
Britain; and foreign officers have greatly improved
the condition of the army.</p>

<p>"Telegraphic communication has been extensively
established, and a railroad eighty-one miles long
has been built. Educational institutions have been
founded, and schools opened for the instruction of
young men in several foreign languages. The increasing
consumption of opium, which seems to have
been placed in the way of the people by the action
on the part of England, is a cause for great regret
among the friends of China. I have said too much
already, and I know you must be very tired. I
thank you for bearing with me so long; and I will
promise not to do so again, at least so far as China
is concerned. China is at peace with all the world,
and I leave her so."</p>

<p>The professor retired with even greater applause
than in the forenoon. Since he spoke, China has
been engaged in a great war with Japan; and possibly
his account of the country will assist those
who are yet to read the history of the conflict.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>SIGHT-SEEING IN HONG-KONG AND CANTON</h3>


<p>After the conclusion of the lecture in the afternoon,
the passengers of the two ships had another
frolic, as Captain Ringgold called it, and then dined
in the cabin; after which those from the Blanche
"went home," as the ladies termed it.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the following day, while
the passengers of the Guardian-Mother were seated
on the promenade, the lookout forward shouted,
"Land, ho!" The announcement caused a sensation,
as usual, though it was an old story. It was
reported off the port bow; and the captain said it
was Lema Island, a considerable distance from Hong-Kong.</p>

<p>"The Chinese name of Hong-Kong is Hiang-Kiang,
which means 'sweet waters,'" said the commander.
"It is a ridge of rocks, the highest point of which
is over eighteen hundred feet above the water. It
is ninety miles south by east of Canton. The island
has an area of twenty-nine square miles, and is not
more than half a mile from the main shore. It is
a barren rock, and you will hardly see a speck of
vegetation on the whole of it. In the south-west
corner of the island is the city of Victoria, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
population of two hundred and twenty-one thousand;
and it is one of the great centres of trade with
Western nations. The principal import is opium,
and the principal exports are tea and silk. We
shall anchor soon in its splendid harbor."</p>

<p>An English pilot was taken; and at sunset the ship
was at anchor, and the party had abundant occupation
in observing the rugged shores, the shipping that
filled the harbor, and especially the Chinese boats,
in charge of boat-women generally. A few junks
were in sight; and they had seen several of them
among the islands which form an archipelago at
the mouth of Canton River, extending some distance
up the stream.</p>

<p>"There are a number of hotels here with English
names," said the captain at dinner; "but I shall
not trouble you to take a vote on the question of
going to one of them, for we shall not remain here
long, not more than one day. Our steamers can go
up to Canton; but I think we had better go up in
one of the regular steamers, not Chinese."</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning, the first thing
in order was to ascend the promontory for the view
it would afford. But they could not walk up, it
was so difficult and tiresome. Before they left the
ship the American consul visited her, and proffered
his assistance to the tourists; for he had read about
the ships in the papers of some of the ports they
had visited.</p>

<p>This gentleman was very kind and very polite, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
while he was on board the party from the Blanche
came to the ship in the steam-launch. He was introduced
to everybody, and advised the travellers
to take Chinese sampans for their visit to the shore,
for the novelty of the thing. The water around
the ship was covered with them, and a sufficient
number of them were taken to accommodate the
party. "The colonel," as the consul was generally
called, talked "pidgin" English, which is practically
a dialect in itself, to the boat-women.</p>

<p>The captain, Mrs. Belgrave, the colonel, and a few
others went in the first sampan, and the lady was
pleased with the women in charge of the craft; and
several children were in a coop at the stern. The
price of the craft was ten cents for half an hour.
In a few minutes they were landed at the town; and
then a crowd of coolies, as the laborers are called
here, surrounded the party with sedans and rickshaws,
and all were anxious for a job. The passengers
waited till all the company had landed, and then
took sedans or rickshaws for the Hong-Kong Hotel.</p>

<p>It required twenty of them to accommodate the
party. The commander and the consul went into the
hotel; and a lunch, or tiffin as it is called here as in
India, was ordered for the tourists at one o'clock.
Then the colonel instructed the coolies where to go,
and the procession started for a round in the city.
The buildings are constructed of granite, which is
the material of the surrounding heights, the dwellings
with verandas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"How is the weather here, Colonel?" asked the
captain, when they stopped to examine a locality.</p>

<p>"The average temperature is seventy-five; and that,
of course, gives us some hot days in summer, which
is a rainy season. Thunder-storms come often; and
once in a while a typhoon breaks in upon us, sometimes
doing an immense amount of damage," replied
the consul. "But the climate is not unhealthy. If
the town had been built around the corner of the
island, it would have been cooler, though we could
not have had this magnificent harbor."</p>

<p>The company had all descended when a stop was
made; and most of them insisted upon walking along
Queen's Road in order to have a better opportunity
to look into the stores, and see the street traders,
for most of the Chinese pursue their business in the
open air. The stores were filled with the curious
goods peculiar to the East, such as China crapes,
porcelain vases, and other wares, and camphor-wood
boxes, proof against moths. The shop people were
well dressed and extremely polite. Several stores
were visited, those indicated by the colonel.</p>

<p>One man, who appeared to be the "boss," sat at
a desk with a little brush, or camel's-hair pencil, for
the natives do not write with pens, and made a tea-chest
character in a kind of book for every article
sold. The salesmen were very skilful in handling
the goods, and showing them in the most tempting
manner. Mrs. Belgrave bought some things that she
fancied; and then came up the question as to how to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
pay for them, for they had no Chinese money. The
colonel helped them out by giving cards, like bank-checks,
payable by the steward of the Hong merchants.</p>

<p>Continuing the walk, they came to a money-changer.
The commander put down two English
sovereigns, for which he received a bag full of the
current coins, which were not the native <i>cash</i>, but
the pieces made for Hong-Kong, as they are made
for the island of Jamaica, where an English penny
will not pass. The smallest was of the value of a
cash, or one mill. A cent was about the size of our
old copper one, and a ten-cent piece was a little
larger than our dime. The value was given in Chinese
as well as English for the benefit of the natives;
and the cash piece had a square hole in the centre,
for the natives keep them on strings or wires.</p>

<p>The captain gave about a half a dollar's worth
of this money to each person, so that none need be
bothered about paying for small articles. The boys
invested a portion of their wealth for a quantity
of Swatow oranges, about the size of heavy bullets.
They could not understand the native seller, and
permitted him to take his pay out of a handful of
coins; but he took next to nothing, and they were
confident they were not cheated, for he took the
same coins from the hands of all.</p>

<p>Among the pedlers all sorts of vegetables were for
sale, and the groper-fish, shark-fin soup, meats minced
with herbs and onions, poultry cut up and sold in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
pieces, stewed goose, bird's-nest soup, rose-leaf soup
with garlic&mdash;heaven with the other place, Scott
called it&mdash;and scores of other eatables for native
palates, and some of them would suit the taste of
Americans.</p>

<p>Taking their places in the vehicles, the tourists
were borne through the principal streets. There
are only five or six thousand English in the city,
and Hong-Kong is substantially Chinese. At about
eleven, the coolies toted the sedans to the top of the
peak, where an observatory is located, following a
zigzag path. The approach of every vessel of any
consequence is signalled from this elevation by flags.
The ascent is difficult, it is so steep; and the bearers
of the sedans had to stop and rest occasionally.
The view is magnificent, and the consul pointed
out the objects of interest.</p>

<p>It was easier to get down the steep than to get
up, and the party reached the hotel at the appointed
time. The lunch was ready, though it was hardly
first-class. When the captain asked about the expense
of living for Europeans in China, the colonel
said that the price per day at the best hotels was
from four to six dollars, and that one could not
keep house for less than four thousand dollars a
year. In summer the people live in bungalows on
the peaks, where quite a town has grown up. The
captain paid the bill in English gold. In the afternoon
the company made an excursion by a regular
steamer to Macao, on the other side of the river,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
forty miles distant. It has been a Portuguese settlement
since 1557; but it had little interest for the
tourists, and they returned by the same steamer, and
went on board of the ship.</p>

<p>The colonel dined on board, and the captain announced
his intention to go to Canton the following
day. The next morning the tourists were on
board of the steamer for that city. The colonel
could not go with them; but he procured a couple
of English guides to attend them, one of whom was
Mr. Inch and the other Mr. Larch.</p>

<p>"Kwang-tung is the native name of the city to
which we are going, and from this the English had
made Canton," said Mr. Larch, as the boat left the
shore; and he proceeded to name the islands in
sight, and point out all objects of interest, as he
did all the way up the river.</p>

<p>The city is on the north side of the Choo-Chiang,
or Pearl River, ninety miles from Hong-Kong. They
saw nothing of especial interest except a temple on
the shore, and a fort with a three-story pagoda
rising from the centre of it. On the arrival of the
steamer off the city, she was surrounded by boats
as at Hong-Kong. The captain of the boat recommended
one he called Tommy, though it was a
woman; and her craft was engaged, with as many
more as were needed, indicated by her.</p>

<p>At the landing-place Mr. Seymour, the American
consul, to whom the colonel had telegraphed, was
waiting for them. He introduced himself, and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
soon on the best of terms with all the tourists. He
advised them to go to the International Hotel, and
they went there. A score of sedans and rickshaws
were at once engaged; and Tommy and the other
women carried the valises and bags for them, each
attended by the owner. They were to remain three
days in Canton. Dinner was the first ceremony they
performed after they went to the hotel, and the
consul joined the party by invitation.</p>

<p>"Canton is a city with a population estimated at
a million and a half, including the people that live
in boats from one year's end to the other, and doubtless
you noticed their aquatic dwellings as you came
up the river," said the consul, who had been invited
to tell the company something about the place. "It
is surrounded by a wall nine miles in length, built
of brick and sandstone, twenty-five to forty feet high,
and twenty feet thick, and divided by a partition
wall into two unequal parts. There are twelve outer
gates, and also gates in the partition wall. The
names of these are curious, as Great Peace Gate,
Eternal Rest Gate, and others like them. There
are more than six hundred streets, lanes you will
call them; for they are not often more than eight
feet wide, very crooked, and very dirty. This is the
general idea of the city, and the details you will see
for yourselves."</p>

<div class='right'><a href="#Page_329"><i>Page 329.</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>After breakfast the next morning the party was
organized for sight-seeing, and the sedans they had
used the day before were ready for them. The two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
guides insisted upon going on foot, the better to
discharge their duties. They rode through some of
the principal streets, looked into the shops, and observed
the pedlers; but all was about the same as
in Hong-Kong, except that the streets were wider
in the latter. The same goods were for sale. They
looked into a tea saloon; and the gentlemen entered
an opium den, which nearly made some of them sick.</p>

<p>"This is called the Plain pagoda," said Mr. Inch,
when they came to it. "It was built a thousand
years ago, and is one hundred and sixty feet high."</p>

<p>They were taken to a couple of Joss-houses, or
temples. A sort of tower attracted their attention;
and they were told that the one before them, and
hundreds of others, were occupied each by a watchman
at night to call out the hours of the night, and
give the alarm in case of fire. They halted before
the nine-story pagoda, the most interesting structure
they had seen, and the most peculiarly Chinese.</p>

<p>"It is one hundred and seventy feet high, and
was built thirteen hundred years ago," Mr. Larch explained.
"Brick, covered with marble or glazed tile,
is the material used. Each story is smaller than the
one below it, and each has a balcony around it."</p>

<p>"Now we come to the Temple of Honam, which
is one of the largest in China," said Mr. Inch, as
they halted before its gates, after the party got out
of the sedans. "With its grounds it covers seven
acres, and one hundred and seventy-five priests are
employed in it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the religion of these people?" asked
Mrs. Woolridge.</p>

<p>"The priests and nuns of Canton number more
than two thousand, and nine-tenths of them are
Buddhists. The Temple of Five Hundred Genii contains
that number of statues, various in size, and was
erected in honor of Buddha and his disciples."</p>

<p>At the usual hour the party went to lunch, and
were tired, though they had done but little walking.
The sedans were dismissed till the next morning;
the afternoon was devoted to an excursion on the
river, and Tommy had been directed to provide the
boats. They moved through the wilderness of floating
dwelling-places, and looked them over with wonder
and surprise. Many of the sampans were made
of three planks; and the people on board of them,
mostly women, were exceedingly amusing.</p>

<p>Large junks, some of them from five hundred to
sixteen hundred tons burden, were to be seen, and
long, broad, flat Chinese men-of-war, with twenty
to forty guns; but the latter are out of fashion now,
and modern-built vessels take their places. They
have two great painted eyes on the bow to enable
them, as the Chinese say, to find their way over the
sea. But the most beautiful sight was the flower-boats,
having galleries decorated with flowers, and
arranged in most fantastic designs. Each of these
floating gardens contains one large apartment and
a number of cabinets. The walls are hung with
mirrors and graceful draperies of silk, and glass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
chandeliers and colored lanterns are suspended from
the ceiling. Elegant little baskets of flowers are
hung in various places. It seems very like fairy-land
on these boats. They are stationary, and dinners
are given on board <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'by'">to</ins> the Chinese who can afford
them. They are also places of amusement by day
and night, and plays, ballets, and conjuring take
place at them; but no respectable females frequent
them.</p>

<p>During the next two days the tourists continued
to wander on foot and in sedans over the city with
the guides. One day they went to the great examination
hall, 1330 feet long by 583 wide, covering
sixteen acres, and containing 8653 cells, in which students
are placed so that there shall be no stealing
others' work.</p>

<p>When a member of the party asked the meaning
of certain tall buildings, he was told that they were
pawnbrokers' offices; for the Chinese have a mania
for pawning their clothes, or whatever they have,
even if not in need of the money, to save the trouble
of taking care of the articles. Before the third day
of the stay in Canton was over, some of the party
had seen enough, and preferred to remain at the
hotel while others were out with the guides. The
next day they returned to Hong-Kong, and were glad
to be once more on board the ships, for sight-seeing
is the most tiresome work in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>SHANG-HAI AND THE YANG-TSZE-CHIANG</h3>


<p>The passengers of the Guardian-Mother were on
deck at an early hour the next morning, and the
smoke was rising from the funnel as though it was
the intention of the commander that she should sail
soon; and some of them began to wonder if they
were to see anything more of China than could be
seen from the deck of the ship.</p>

<p>"Well, ladies and gentlemen, have you seen all
you wish of China?" said Captain Ringgold, as he
seated himself at the head of the table at breakfast.</p>

<p>"We can put it to vote," suggested Mrs. Belgrave.</p>

<p>"I don't think it is necessary," replied the commander,
laughing. "We shall sail this forenoon for
Shang-hai, for I suppose that some of you who keep
hens wish to see the home of the famous rooster
that bears that name."</p>

<p>"I thought yesterday afternoon that I had seen
enough of China to last me the rest of my lifetime;
but I feel a little different this morning since I got
rested," said Mrs. Woolridge.</p>

<p>"It is said that travellers enjoy their visits to
foreign countries more after they get home, and think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
over what they have seen, than they do while going
from place to place," added Mrs. Belgrave. "I think
of a hundred things I saw in Canton, and did not
understand, that I shall recall when I read about
China, as I intend to do when I get home."</p>

<p>"That is just my idea!" exclaimed Mrs. Woolridge.
"It will take me three years, at least, after I
get home to read up what I have seen on this voyage."</p>

<p>Much more in the same general direction was said
by others. When they went on deck they found the
pilot who had brought the ship into port walking
back and forth. He had brought off the <i>China Mail</i>,
and three other newspapers in English, and a pile
of others in Chinese to be kept as curiosities by the
party. The captain had obtained his clearance and
other papers the day before, as soon as he arrived
from Canton, with the assistance of the colonel, who
had come off with the pilot to make his adieux. In
less than half an hour the ship was under way again,
with the Blanche following her.</p>

<p>"How far is it to Shang-hai?" asked Mrs. Belgrave,
as she met the captain in front of the pilot-house.</p>

<p>"It is eight hundred and seventy miles, and the
voyage will require two days and fourteen hours,"
he replied. "I shall keep well to the eastward, and
if you are up by six to-morrow morning you will
see the island of Formosa. Then we shall be about
on the Tropic of Cancer, when we shall pass out of
the Torrid Zone&mdash;out of the tropics."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>This information was circulated by the lady among
all the passengers. Before noon the ship was out of
sight of land, and the voyage was just about the
same as it had been in smooth seas and pleasant
weather. All the party were seated on the promenade
at six o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p>"But there is land on both sides of us, Captain
Ringgold," said Mrs. Belgrave. "Which is Formosa?"</p>

<p>"That on your right. We are going through the
Formosa Channel; and the islands on the port side
are the Pescadores, about twenty miles from Formosa."</p>

<p>After breakfast, when the ship had passed the
smaller islands, and the passengers were seated on the
promenade, the commander opened upon them with
a talk about Formosa: "The name of the island
in Chinese is Taiwan; and it is off the province
of Fu-chien, and from ninety to two hundred and
twenty miles from it. It has an area of 14,978
square miles, or about the size of the States of Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Connecticut put together.
It has a chain of mountains through it, the highest
peak of which"&mdash;and the speaker looked at his memoranda&mdash;"is
12,847 feet high.</p>

<p>"The number of inhabitants is estimated at about
2,000,000, mostly immigrants from China, with the
original natives. The island is exceedingly rich in
its vegetation, and the plants are about the same
as those of the main land. Rice paper is made of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the pith of a tree found only in Formosa. In the
south sugar and turmeric are the staples. The latter
is a plant whose root is bright yellow, used in dyeing
silk. Formosa tea has become well known at home
as of excellent quality. Other productions are about
the same as in southern China.</p>

<p>"There are plenty of birds there, but no wild animals
of any consequence that are game for the Nimrods.
A great deal more might be said about the
island, but you have more now than you are likely
to remember. You can see many junks now, and
the trade with China is mostly carried on in them;
and some of them are pirates in these seas, even
to the south of Hainan, for a trading-junk turns into
a pirate when her captain can make some money
by it."</p>

<p>After lunch the Blanche's people came on board,
and all hands had the usual frolic during the afternoon
and evening. The next morning the captain
told his passengers that they had passed out of the
China Sea the day before, and that they were on the
Tung-hai, or Eastern Sea, outside of which was
the broad Pacific Ocean. On the third morning from
Hong-Kong, when the company came on deck, they
found the Guardian-Mother at anchor, but just getting
under way with an English pilot on board, who
had been taken late the evening before.</p>

<p>"Where are we now, Captain Ringgold?" asked
Mr. Woolridge, when the party had seated themselves
on the promenade to see what was to be seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are at the mouth of the great river Yang-tsze-Chiang;
but we shall soon pass into a branch of it
called the Woo-Sung, and find Shang-hai, for it is
correctly written with a hyphen between the syllables,"
replied the commander. "But the tide is
right; and we can go over the bar without any delay,
the pilot says. It is about twelve miles up the river
to the town; and, as you can see, the country is low
and flat. The city has 250,000 inhabitants, and is
the principal central port of China for foreign
trade."</p>

<p>The channel of the river was crowded with junks,
and there are sometimes as many as three thousand
of them between the town and the sea; but they were
careful to keep out of the track of steamers, even
though they had the right of way. The two steamers
picked their way through the native boats, and they
were at anchor off the city in season for the late
breakfast ordered.</p>

<p>"Shang-hai stands on low ground; and cholera,
dysentery, and fevers prevail here in summer," said
the commander when they were all seated at the
table. "The English, French, and American quarters
are in the suburb north of the native city, and
they have broad and clean streets; but in the city
proper, they are narrow and filthy, not unlike those
of Canton. It is enclosed by a wall five miles in
extent. What else there is here you can see for
yourselves."</p>

<p>The captain decided, after the pacha came on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
board in his barge with the rest of his party, to
lunch and dine at the Astor House, perhaps because
the name sounded like home; but he found that the
hotel "was a horse of another color." They went on
shore in some of the native boats that crowded
around the ship; and their first care was to secure six
guides, all that offered their services on the quay.
The next was to procure a supply of the money current
in the city, which was accomplished with the
aid of the principal guide, all of whom were English,
who could speak Chinese and pidgin.</p>

<p>The company were then divided into six parties,
who had suggested this plan when they found that
this number of guides could be obtained. The "Big
Four" went together, and the rest of the company
were in parties of three. The conveyances were
found to be small, low broughams, pony gigs, palanquins,
jinrickishas, and wheelbarrows, the last such
as the party had seen in Cholan. The boys decided
to walk first, and try the vehicles later. They went
into a shop where Louis saw something in a window
he wanted, and the guide asked the price for him.
The dealer refused to show the article, or to name a
price, unless Louis would agree to buy if he did so.</p>

<p>They were not like the Hong-Kong salesmen; for
there were several of them, and they were impolite
enough to make fun of the tourists. Scott doubled
his fists, and was inclined to pitch into the one who
refused to show any goods till they were practically
sold; but Louis begged him to desist. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
next went into a tea saloon in the middle of a dirty
pond of water, which would have just suited the
taste of a Dutchman at home.</p>

<p>The tea was given to them in the cups, and they
poured in hot water. The keeper swindled them in
asking about five times the price, and the guide remonstrated;
but the fellow was saucy, and the charge
was paid to avoid trouble. The guide said the other
fellow would have cheated them in the same ratio, if
Louis had agreed, as he required, to buy. Then they
looked into an opium joint, where the smokers were
reclining on broad benches. The pipe was a tube
with the bowl on the top. The drug is boiled till it
is of the consistency of honey. Something like a
knitting-needle is then taken by the smoker, the end
of which is dipped in the jar; the needle is then
turned till the opium becomes a ball as big as a pea.
It is then held in a flame till it is partially lighted,
when it is dropped into the bowl of a pipe. The
amount used is counted in pipes, some being satiated
with two or three of them, while the hard cases require
twenty. In either case he goes to sleep, and
has pleasant dreams. The habit is very deleterious
to those who practise it, and death results from excessive
use of the drug.</p>

<p>"There is a sedan with a Chinese magnate in it,
with four bearers," said the guide; "but it is not so
common here as in Hong-Kong and Canton."</p>

<p>The barrow excited the attention of the boys more
than the other vehicles. At the door of the shop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
they saw a native reading a paper, wearing a pair of
spectacles whose eyes were almost as big as saucers.
After walking through the streets of Hong-Kong and
Canton, the boys saw very little that was new to
them.</p>

<p>"Is there a cemetery in the town?" asked Louis,
after they had become somewhat tired, not to say
disgusted, with the dirty streets, and the crowd in
them.</p>

<p>"Nothing that you Americans would call by that
name," replied the guide. "There are some small
burial-grounds; but the Chinese generally bury their
dead in private grounds, outside of the cities. They
have a reverence for their dead which is not equalled
by any people on the face of the earth. The graves
of the rich and noted are very carefully selected, and
are decorated with great care and taste. Some of the
finest gardens in the country are those enclosed in a
private burial-place.</p>

<p>"A rich Chinaman thinks more of his coffin than
he does of his house. He often buys it years before
he has occasion to use it, and keeps it, taking better
care of it than he does of his female children.
Wherever a Chinaman dies, he must be sent home to
be buried; and many of them come here from America,
taken up from the earth even a year or more
after death."</p>

<p>At this point the party came to an open place
where there were all the different vehicles used in
the city waiting to be employed; and as it was nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
time for the lunch, they decided to ride to the hotel.
Louis took a rickshaw, as it is called here; Scott
and Morris preferred a wheelbarrow, and Felix took
another, balanced by the guide. They were novel conveyances
to the boys, and they enjoyed the ride very
much. The rest of the parties returned to the hotel
about the same time. There were Chinese dishes on
the table; and those who had tried some of them before
ordered them, especially the bird's-nest soups.
The hams were very nice, and the captain hoped that
Mr. Sage had procured some of them for the ship.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent as the forenoon had been,
but the party found little to interest them. The
next day the tourists made an excursion up the Yang-tsze-Chiang,
and enjoyed it very much. They saw a
little of the farming operations, as a man ploughing
with a buffalo, which looked more like a deer than a
bovine; others carrying bundles of grain, one at each
end of a pole on their shoulders; another threshing by
beating a bunch of the stalks on a frame like a ladder
or clothes-horse; but what pleased them most were
the fishermen. One had a net several feet square,
suspended at the end of a pole. It was sunk in the
water, and then hauled up. Any fish that happened
to be over it then was brought up with it; but Scott
declared that this device was an old story, and they
were used in the United States, though an iron hoop
was the frame of the net.</p>

<p>They were more interested in the fishing with cormorants.
A man with a dip-net in his hand stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
on a bamboo raft, on which was a basket like those
the snake-charmers use in India, to receive his fish.
The birds were about the size of geese. They dived
into the water, and brought up a fish every time.
They have a ring or cord on their necks so that they
cannot swallow their prizes, and they drop them into
the dip-net.</p>

<p>They went up as far as Taiping, where they took
a returning steamer, and that night slept on board
the ships. On the following morning the steamers
went down the river; and then the question where
they were to go next came up, and the commander
soon settled it by announcing that the ship was
bound to Tien-tsin, on the way to Pekin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3>THE WALLS AND TEMPLES OF PEKIN</h3>


<p>The company had hardly expected that Captain
Ringgold would go to the capital, for it was off the
course to Japan, which was the next country to
be visited; but their curiosity had been greatly
excited, and he was disposed to gratify it.</p>

<p>"Pekin is not on navigable water, and we cannot
go there in the ship," said he. "We go to
Tien-tsin, which is the seaport of Pekin, about
eighty miles distant from it. It is a treaty port,
and is said to have a population of six hundred
thousand; the number can doubtless be considerably
discounted. The next thing is to get to Pekin;
though we can go most of the way by boat to Tung-chow,
thirteen miles from the capital. Some go all
the way on horseback or by cart. We will decide
that question when we get to Tien-tsin."</p>

<p>"How long will it take us to go there?" asked
Uncle Moses.</p>

<p>"About two days; we are off Woo-Sung now. We
have the pilot on board, and we shall go to sea at
once," replied the commander.</p>

<p>Nothing of especial interest occurred on the voyage;
and before noon on the second day out the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
ships were off the mouth of the Pei-ho River, and a
Chinese pilot was taken. As they went up the river
they saw the Taku forts, where the Celestial soldiers
won their only victory over the English, but were
badly beaten the following year. On the rising tide
the ships got up the river, and anchored off the
town.</p>

<p>The place was like any other Chinese city, and
was quite as dirty as the dirtiest of them. Two of
the guides from Shang-hai, who were couriers for
travellers, had been brought, one in each ship; and
both of them were intelligent men. The Blanchita
had been put into the water as soon as the anchors
were buried in the mud; and the party went on
shore in her, to the great disgust of the boat-people.</p>

<p>The American consul came on board with the
Chinese officials; and the commander took him into
the cabin for a conference in regard to getting to
Pekin, while the tourists were on shore with the
guides. Mr. Smithers had seen the steam-launch,
and the question was whether the party could go
up Pekin River in her. The consul could see no
difficulty in the way, any more than there would
be in the ships' barges. He thought he could put
them in the way of making the trip securely, and
they went on shore together in the barge.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers knew a couple of high officials who
were going to the capital the next day, and the commander
was introduced to them. They were very
polite, and both of them spoke English. One had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
been educated at Yale College in New Haven. They
were invited to go with the party to Pekin in the
Blanchita, and accepted. The arrangements were
completed for the trip. They went on board of
the Guardian-Mother, and were treated with the
most distinguished consideration, shown over the
ship, and invited to lunch.</p>

<p>When the launch came off with the party at noon,
all the ladies and gentlemen were presented to
them by the commander. The pacha, the rajah,
and the princess were clothed in their elegant robes;
and they evidently made a profound impression.
The plan for the journey to the capital was announced
to the passengers, and they could not help
being delighted with it. Mr. Sage had been directed
to spread himself on the lunch, and he did so. Monsieur
Odervie even prepared a few Chinese dishes,
the art of doing which he had learned from a native
cook in Hong-Kong.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the party went on shore again,
under the escort of Mr. Psi-ning and Mr. Ying-chau,
visiting the temple in which the treaties had been
signed, and several others, and then walked through
the street of "Everlasting Prosperity," as the Chinese
gentlemen explained it. The prosperity seemed to
consist mainly in the sale of eel-pies with baked
potatoes, the former kept hot at a small charcoal
fire. Live fish in shallow bowls with a little water
in them were common, and cook-shops for more elaborate
Chinese dishes were abundant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Both the native gentlemen were <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'mandarans'">mandarins</ins> of
different orders, and they were received with the
most profound deference by the common people.
The tourists saw everything in the town that was
worth seeing; and early in the afternoon they returned
to the Guardian-Mother, where the consul
and the native gentlemen were to dine. The latter
were invited to sleep on board in order to be in
readiness for an early start the next day, and they
had ordered their baggage to be sent to the ship.
Mr. Psi-ning said he had telegraphed to an official
at Tung-chow to have conveyances ready for the
party at that place, which was as far as the boat
could go, thirteen miles from Pekin.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers was exceedingly kind, and did far
more than could be expected of a consul. The
commander expressed his obligations to him in the
most earnest terms for all he had done, and especially
for introducing the distinguished Chinese gentlemen.
The dinner was the most elaborate the
steward and the cook could provide, and it was one
of those hilarious affairs which have several times
been described during the voyage. In the evening
there were Mrs. Belgrave's games, music, and dancing
with the assistance of the Italian band, and
finally the singing of the Gospel Hymns.</p>

<p>The Blanchita was prepared for her voyage as
soon as she came off from the shore, coaled for the
round trip, supplied with cooked provisions, though
the galley was available, and with everything that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
could possibly be needed. She was put in about
the same trim as when she went up the rivers of
Borneo. Felipe was to be the engineer, Pitts the
cook, and four sailors were detailed for deck-hands.
The excursion had been arranged for five days; and
the bags, valises, and other impedimenta of the
voyagers, were on deck at an early hour. Breakfast
was ready at half-past six; and at half-past seven
the Blanchita got under way with a native pilot for
the river, who could speak pidgin English.</p>

<p>The party were in a frolicsome mood; and they
went off singing a song, to the great astonishment
of the native boat-people. Mr. Psi-ning joined with
them; for he had learned the tunes in the United
States, where he had travelled extensively. Tien-tsin
is the terminus of the Grand Canal in the
north, and they passed through a small portion of
it into the river. The trip was through a low country.
The road to the capital was in sight, and they
saw various vehicles moving upon it. The first that
attracted their attention was one of the barrows, with
a native between the handles, supporting them with
a band over his shoulders. On one side of the large
wheel was a passenger; and behind him was a lofty
sail, like those depending from the yards of a ship,
but about three times as high in proportion to its
width. It had five ribs of wood in it below the
upper yard to keep it spread out. The boys thought
the craft would be inclined to heel over with all the
cargo on the starboard side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>They saw a rickshaw rigged with a sail in this
manner. A man on a farm was working with an
ordinary wheelbarrow sailing in this way. There
were no end of men riding ponies, or in the two-wheeled
passenger-carts having a cover over them
which extended out over the horse. Farther up
they observed a couple of coolies irrigating the land
with a machine which had four paddles for moving
the water, with four more each side of the stream,
under a frame to which two men were holding on,
and working treadmill fashion, with their feet on
each of the four arms. They noticed mixed teams
of horses and bullocks, such as one sees in Naples.
The most curious was a mule-litter, which was simply
a sedan between two animals.</p>

<p>Felipe drove the launch at a nine-knot speed, and
at half-past three in the afternoon the boat arrived at
Tung-chow. Contrary to their expectation, the passengers
had greatly enjoyed the trip; but it was out
of their own hilarity rather than their surroundings.
Pitts had arranged the lunch in a very tasty manner
on the tables in what the boys had called the fore
and after cabins. They found all the variety of
vehicles they had seen on the road, and in three
hours they came to the great gate of Pekin. They
were conveyed to the small German hotel, which
they more than filled; and other lodgings were provided
for some of the gentlemen, though the meals
were to be taken at the public-house.</p>

<p>The Chinese gentlemen had to leave them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
attend to their own affairs, but after dinner the
professor told them something about Pekin: "The
city is in about the same latitude as New York,
and the climate is about the same. It is situated
on a sandy plain, and the suburbs are comparatively
few. The town consists of two cities, the Manchu
and the Chinese, separated by a wall; and the whole
is surrounded by high walls, with towers and pagodas
on them, as you have already seen. The Manchu
wall is fifty feet high, sixty feet wide at the bottom,
and forty at the top. Without the cross-walls, there
are twenty-one miles of outer wall, enclosing twenty-six
square miles of ground.</p>

<p>"There are sixteen gates, each with a tower a
hundred feet high on it. Your first impression
must have been that Pekin is the greatest city in
the world. You came in by a street two hundred
feet wide, with shops on each side; but when you
have seen more of it, you will find dilapidation and
decay, and about the same filth you have observed
in other Chinese cities. But it is one of the most
ancient cities in the world, for this or another city
stood here twelve hundred years before Christ.
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Kublai'">Kubl&acirc;i</ins>, a grandson of Genghis Khan, the great conqueror
of the Moguls, made Pekin the capital of
all China. When the Manchus came into power the
city was all ready for them, and for a time they
kept it in repair; but for more than a hundred
years it has been going to ruin.</p>

<p>"The Manchu, or inner city, is divided into three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
parts, the largest of which is the real city. In the
middle of it are two walled enclosures, one within
the other. The outer one seems to be the guardroom
of the inner, to which entrance is forbidden
to all foreigners, and even to Manchus and Chinese
not connected with the court. This last is called the
Purple Forbidden City, two and a quarter miles
around it, and is the actual imperial residence. It
includes the palaces of the emperor and empress
and other members of the family. It contains other
palaces and halls of reception.</p>

<p>"The 'Hall of Grand Harmony' is built on a
terrace twenty feet high, and is of marble, one hundred
and ten feet high. Its chief apartment is two
hundred feet long by ninety wide, and contains a
throne for the emperor, who holds his receptions
here on New Year's Day, his birthday, and on other
great occasions. The 'Palace of Heavenly Purity'
is where the monarch meets his cabinet at dawn for
business; and you see that he must be an early riser.
Within these enclosures are temples, parks, an artificial
lake a mile long, a great temple in which the
imperial family worship their ancestors, and many
other grand palaces, temples, and statues, which I
have not time to mention.</p>

<p>"The outer, or Chinese, city, is thinly populated,
and a considerable portion of it is under cultivation.
The principal streets are over a hundred feet wide;
but those at the sides of them, like Canton and other
cities, are nothing but lanes. None of the streets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
are paved, and mud and dust reign supreme. As
with other Eastern cities, the population of Pekin is
exaggerated, being estimated by some as high as two
millions; but Dr. Legge thought it was less than
one million.</p>

<p>"The charge of infanticide seems not to be applicable
to Pekin or the surrounding country, and
is said to be almost unknown there. A dead-cart
passes through the streets at early morning to pick
up the bodies of children dying from ordinary causes
whose parents are too poor to bury them. There
are foundling hospitals, to which the mothers prefer
to take their female children rather than sacrifice
them. In fact, infanticide is said to be known only
in four or five provinces. I have nothing more to
say, and I leave you to see the rest for yourselves,"
said the professor, as he resumed his seat.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Psi-ning presented himself
at the hotel, before which were gathered vehicles
enough to accommodate the entire party. The rickshaw
had recently been introduced from Japan, and
several of them were included in the number; but
the carts and the barrows were generally preferred.
The company selected what they pleased. Mr. Psi-ning
led the way through the principal street, and
through some of the lanes; but the scenes in them
were so much like what they had seen in three other
cities that the novelty of them had worn off. The
residences of the ambassadors of foreign countries
were pointed out to them, including that of the Hon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
C. Denby, before which they halted; and the Chinese
gentleman conducted them all into it, where they
were presented in due form to His Excellency, who
received them very pleasantly.</p>

<p>They then went to the Temple of Heaven, which
was quite a curious building, somewhat in pagoda
style. It began on the ground at a round structure,
with an overhanging roof. The second story was
smaller, with the same kind of a roof; and the third
was the same, but with a roof coming to a point,
like a cone. It was almost a hundred feet high.
The tiles were of blue porcelain, in imitation of a
clear sky.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the tourists were conveyed to the
office of the Board of Punishments, and Mr. Psi-ning
explained the criminal processes and sentences.
The latter are very severe, including torture, which
makes one think that he is reading Foxe's "Book of
Martyrs." The party declined to witness any of the
punishments. Some culprits are treated to twenty
or more blows with a bamboo. Men suspected are
tortured to make them confess. They are put in
all sorts of painful positions.</p>

<p>Capital punishment is inflicted by placing the victim
on his knees, with his arms bound behind him,
and his head is severed from his body by the stroke
of a heavy knife or sword.</p>

<p>The next day the mandarin conducted the tourists
to the gate of the Forbidden City; for he had obtained
a permit for the admission of the whole of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
them in a body. The professor had described the
principal structures within the enclosure; and it would
be only a repetition to report what the mandarin
said of them, though he added considerable to what
had come from the books. The third gateway was
especially noted as one of the finest pieces of Chinese
architecture the party had seen.</p>

<p>The "Abode of Heavenly Calmness" was the noblest,
richest, and most luxuriously furnished in the
great palace; for it is the private apartment of the
emperor. The Great Union Saloon, where His Imperial
Majesty receives the high-class mandarins, was
elegant enough for any royal apartment.</p>

<p>The tourists walked about among the Chinese
glories till they were tired out. The two Cupids
were completely "blown;" and when they found a
place, they seated themselves, and let the rest of the
company finish the survey of the Forbidden City.
The palace of one prince of the imperial house was
so large that three thousand men could be quartered
in the out-buildings, and doubtless as many more
could be accommodated in the main structure. The
Cupids were picked up on the return; but there was
more to be seen, and they went to the beautiful temple
of Fo, containing a gilded bronze statue of the
god, sixty feet high, with one hundred arms, and
Scott remarked that he was like a big man-of-war,
well armed.</p>

<p>They came again to the Temple of Heaven; but
the mandarin had not obtained a permit, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
exceedingly difficult to procure in recent years. Mr.
Psi-ning told them that the interior, in its chief
hall, represented the heavens. It was a circular
apartment surrounded by twenty-two pillars, and
everything was painted sky-blue. A portion of this
temple is the "Penitential Retreat" of the emperor,
where he keeps three days of fasting, meditating
over his own sins and those of the government, previous
to offering up his sacrifice. Connected with
the temple was a band of five hundred musicians,
who reside there; but the commander was thankful
that the party were not compelled to listen to
their performance.</p>

<p>The tourists were very glad to get back to the
hotel in the street of the legations, and they did not
go out again that day. The question of visiting the
Great Wall then came up for discussion. Brother
Avoirdupois and Brother Adipose Tissue declared in
the beginning that they would not go; and the mandarin
laughed heartily when these names were applied
to them, and still more when they were called the
Cupids.</p>

<p>"It is forty-five miles to the loop-wall which travellers
generally visit from Pekin," said Mr. Psi-ning.
"You would have to go in mule-litters, or on horseback,
or by the carts you have used; and it would
take you a day to get there, and as long to return.
Then it would be only the loop-wall, and not the
Great Wall, which cannot be reached without going
over a hundred miles. I can say for myself that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
have never been to either, just as I heard a man in
Boston say that he had lived there over sixty years,
and had never been to Bunker Hill Monument."</p>

<p>"The wall is an old story to you, I suppose," said
the princess.</p>

<p>"You have seen the walls of Pekin, and they are
a good specimen of the Great Wall; at any rate,
they satisfied me," replied the mandarin.</p>

<p>But the "Big Four" and Professor Giroud decided
to visit the loop-wall, and the Chinese gentleman advised
them to start immediately after lunch. One
of the guides, who had been there several times before,
was to accompany them, and was sure they
could reach their destination by sunset; and they
started as soon as they had lunched. Mr. Psi procured
for them six fine horses and a mule-litter.
The road was paved with solid granite slabs, ten
feet long, all the way.</p>

<p>The attentive mandarin kept the rest of the tourists
very busy the next two days; and they visited
everything that was worth seeing in the capital, and
they dined with him one day in his palace. The
party from the wall returned before night the next
day, and said they had had a good time, though the
wall did not amount to much more than that seen
at Pekin.</p>

<p>"I have a government mission in Tokyo next week,
and I have to go to Japan," said Mr. Psi-ning, while
they were dining together at the German Hotel. "I
shall probably meet you there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you are going to Japan, permit me to offer
you a stateroom on board of the Guardian-Mother,"
interposed the commander eagerly. "You are practically
an American after a five years' residence in
the United States, and are familiar with our way
of living; though I will add that Monsieur Odervie,
our French cook, has learned to make a few Chinese
dishes, and we will endeavor to make you comfortable."</p>

<p>"Your living will suit me perfectly, for I am
used to it; and having dined with you on board,
I know that your bill of fare is better than any
hotel in the States. But when do you sail?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you are ready, my dear sir."</p>

<p>"I have to spend a day in Tien-tsin, and then
I was to take a steamer to Shang-hai, and thence
a P. &amp; O. to Yokohama."</p>

<p>"But that is out of the way; and we go direct
to Yokohama, or we will go there first if you honor
us with your company," said the captain, glancing at
General Noury.</p>

<p>"By all means!" exclaimed the pacha. "Mrs.
Noury and myself will be delighted to have you with
us, Mr. Psi-ning."</p>

<p>"Then I shall be too happy to accept your cordial
invitation," replied the mandarin. That matter was
settled; and the new passenger went to his palace
to prepare for his journey, though he did not forget
to send one of his people to Tung-chow to arrange
for the reception of the party the next day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>The horses the young men rode, the mule-litters,
wheelbarrows, and jinrikishas were at the door of
the hotel early in the morning; and the mandarin,
with his valet, were on time. The company reached
Tung-chow before noon; and a Chinese lunch was
ready for them, ordered by the new passenger. The
Blanchita was all ready for them to step on board
when they had partaken of roast goose, duck, and
chicken at the inn. The passage down the river
was a frolic all the way, and the guest told them
more about China than they had learned before in
regard to matters not generally known.</p>

<p>Felipe hurried the steamer, and she was alongside
the Guardian-Mother before five in the afternoon.
Mr. Psi-ning had several pieces of baggage, including
despatch-bags, which were placed in the finest stateroom
on board. The commander had telegraphed for
dinner at the usual hour. Mr. Smithers came on
board before it was ready, and was invited to join
the company. From him they learned that Mr.
Psi-ning was in the diplomatic service of the government,
and that he would be of great assistance to
them in Japan.</p>

<p>The ships had to wait only one day for him;
and on Wednesday, May 10, at six in the morning,
they sailed for Tokyo, though the commander's
original intention had been to go first to Nagasaki.
The Blanche's party went on board of the Guardian-Mother
before she sailed, with the Italian band.
They played to the great delight of the boatmen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
around the ship, as well as of those on board. The
consul went to the mouth of the river, and took a tug
home. It was a frolic all day and till midnight,
when the Blanche's passengers returned to her.</p>

<p>It was a smooth sea all the four days of the voyage,
even on the Pacific shores; and the Guardian-Mother's
people spent the next day on board of the
consort. On the third day there was a lecture on
Japan in Conference Hall, given by Mr. Psi-ning, who
was as familiar with that country as with China.
But his discourse must be reported in another volume.</p>

<p>Those who are disposed to follow the tourists
through Japan, and then on their long voyage of two
thousand miles to Australia, New Zealand, and the
Sandwich Islands, will be enabled to do so in "<span class="smcap">Pacific
Shores; or, Adventures in Eastern Seas</span>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One of the most interesting American novels we have ever read."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
City Item.</i></p>

<p>"This story treats of a fortune of three million dollars left a youthful heir.
The volume bears evidence in every chapter of the fresh, original, and fascinating
style which has always enlivened Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams'</span> productions. We have the
same felicitous manner of working out the plot by conversation, the same
quaint wit and humor, and a class of characters which stand out boldly, pen

By <span class="smcap">Oliver Optic</span>. Illustrated. $1.50.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This story records the experience of a bank officer in the downward career of
crime. The career ought, perhaps, to have ended in the State's prison; but
the author chose to represent the defaulter as sharply punished in another way.
The book contains a most valuable lesson; and shows, in another leading
character, the true life which a young business man ought to lead.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Many who have not time and patience to wade through a long story will
find here many pithy and sprightly tales, each sharply hitting some social
absurdity or social vice. We recommend the book heartily after having read
the three chapters on 'Taking a Newspaper.' If all the rest are as sensible
and interesting as these, and doubtless they are, the book is well worthy of
patronage."&mdash;<i>Vermont Record.</i></p>

<p>"As a writer of domestic stories, Mr. <span class="smcap">William T. Adams</span> (<span class="smcap">Oliver Optic</span>)
made his mark even before he became so immensely popular through his
splendid books for the young. In the volume before us are given several of
these tales, and they comprise a book which will give them a popularity greater
than they have ever before enjoyed. They are written in a spirited style,
impart valuable practical lessons, and are of the most lively interest."&mdash;<i>Boston

<div class='hang1'><b>Our Standard Bearer.</b> A Life of Gen. U. S. Grant. By
<span class="smcap">Oliver Optic</span>. Illustrated by <span class="smcap">Thomas Nast</span>. Illuminated
covers, $1.50.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It has long been out of print, but now comes out in a new edition, with a
narrative of the civil career of the General as President for two terms, his
remarkable journey abroad, his life in New York, and his sickness, death, and
burial. Perhaps the reader will remember that the narrative is told by
"Captain Galligasken" after a style that is certainly not common or tiresome,
but, rather, in a direct, simple, picturesque, and inspiring way that wins the
heart of the young reader. For the boy who wants to read the life of General
Grant, this book is the best that has been published,&mdash;perhaps the only one
that is worth any consideration.</p></div>


<div class='hang1'><b>Just His Luck.</b> By <span class="smcap">Oliver Optic</span>. Illustrated. $1.00.</div>

qualities of mind; with boys of generous impulses and large hearts; with boys
who delight in playing pranks, and who are ever ready for any sort of mischief;
and with boys in whom human nature is strongly engrafted. They are boys,
as many of us have been; boys in the true, unvarnished sense of the word;
boys with hopes, ideas, and inspirations, but lacking in judgment, self-control,
and discipline. And the book contains an appropriate moral, teaches many a
lesson, and presents many a precept worthy of being followed. It is a capital
book for boys."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In this story the author recounts the hardships of a young lad in his first
endeavor to start out for himself. It is a tale that is full of enthusiasm and
budding hopes. The writer shows how hard the youths of a century ago were
compelled to work. This he does in an entertaining way, mingling fun and
adventures with their daily labors. The hero is a striking example of the
honest boy, who is not too lazy to work, nor too dull to thoroughly appreciate
a joke.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is full of spirit and adventure, and presents a plucky hero who was willing
to 'bide his time,' no matter how great the expectations that he indulged in
from his uncle's vast wealth, which he did not in the least covet.... He was
left a poor orphan in Ohio at seventeen years of age, and soon after heard of a
rich uncle, who lived near Boston. He sets off on the long journey to Boston,
finds his uncle, an eccentric old man, is hospitably received by him, but seeks
employment in a humble way, and proves that he is a persevering and plucky
young man."&mdash;<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p></div>

chapters by thousands who have read and re-read many times his preceding
tales. One of his greatest charms is his absolute truthfulness. He does not
depict little saints, or incorrigible rascals, but just <i>boys</i>. This same fidelity to
nature is seen in his latest book, "The Scarlet Tanager, and Other Bipeds."
There is enough adventure in this tale to commend it to the liveliest reader,

plunder was a silver medal that had been given to one John Harrison by the

Benton Barry was one of the wretched housebreakers. This is the summary

finds the road to fortune an unpleasantly rough one."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>"The glimpses we get of New England character are free from any distortion,
and their humorous phases are always entertaining. Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge's</span>

<p>"This is a capital story for boys. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> never tells a story poorly.
It teaches honesty, integrity, and friendship, and how best they can be promoted.
It shows the danger of hasty judgment and circumstantial evidence;

has undertaken to show how very near an innocent boy can come to the guilty
edge and yet be able by fortunate circumstances to rid himself of all suspicion
of evil. There is something winsome about the hero; but he has a singular
way of falling into bad luck, although the careful reader will never feel the
least disposed to doubt his honesty.... It is the pain and perplexity which
impart to the story its intense interest."&mdash;<i>Syracuse Standard.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As for the hero of this story, 'His One Fault' was absent-mindedness. He
forgot to lock his uncle's stable door, and the horse was stolen. In seeking to
recover the stolen horse, he unintentionally stole another. In trying to restore
the wrong horse to his rightful owner, he was himself arrested. After no end
of comic and dolorous adventures, he surmounted all his misfortunes by downright
pluck and genuine good feeling. It is a noble contribution to juvenile
literature."&mdash;<i>Woman's Journal.</i></p></div>


<div class='hang1'><b>Peter Budstone.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Trowbridge's</span> other books have been admirable and deservedly popular,
but this one, in our opinion, is the best yet. It is a story at once spirited and
touching, with a certain dramatic and artistic quality that appeals to the literary
sense as well as to the story-loving appetite. In it Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> has not
lectured or moralized or remonstrated; he has simply shown boys what they
are doing when they contemplate hazing. By a good artistic impulse we are
not shown the hazing at all; when the story begins, the hazing is already over,
and we are introduced immediately to the results. It is an artistic touch also
that the boy injured is not hurt because he is a fellow of delicate nerves, but because
of his very strength, and the power with which he resisted until overcome
by numbers, and subjected to treatment which left him insane. His insanity
takes the form of harmless delusion, and the absurdity of his ways and talk
enables the author to lighten the sombreness without weakening the moral, in
a way that ought to win all boys to his side."&mdash;<i>The Critic.</i></p></div>

Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If to make children's stories as true to nature as the stories which the
masters of fiction write for children of a larger growth be an uncommon
achievement, and one that is worthy of wide recognition, that recognition
should be given to Mr. <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span> for his many achievements in this
difficult walk of literary art. Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> has a good perception of
character, which he draws with skill; he has abundance of invention, which he
never abuses; and he has, what so many American writers have not, an easy,
graceful style, which can be humorous, or pathetic, or poetic."&mdash;<i>R. H. Stoddard

<div class='hang1'><b>Father Brighthopes:</b> <span class="smcap">An Old Clergyman's Vacation</span>. By
<span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This book was published in the early fifties by Phillips, Sampson &amp; Co., of
which firm Mr. Lee (of Lee and Shepard) was then a member. It was very
favorably received, and was followed by other stories,&mdash;a long series of them,&mdash;still
lengthening, and which, it is hoped, may be prolonged indefinitely.
Recently a new edition has appeared, and for a preface the author has related
with touching simplicity the account of his first experience in authorship.</p>

<p>It is well known that Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> is primarily a poet. Some beautiful
poems of his were printed in the early numbers of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> (in
company with poems by <span class="smcap">Longfellow, Emerson, Lowell</span>, and <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>),
and were well received. "At Sea" is a gem that has become classic. The
poetic faculty has not been without use to the story-writer. The perception of
beauty in nature and in human nature is always evident even in his realistic
prose. But his poetic gift never leads him into sentimentality, and his characters
are true children of men, with natural faults as well as natural gifts and
graces. His stories are intensely <i>human</i>, with a solid basis, and with an
instinctive dramatic action. He has never written an uninteresting book.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The scenes are full of human interest and lifelikeness, and will please many
an old reader, as well as the younger folks for whose delectation it is intended.
As in all the books of this author the spirit is manly, sincere, and in the best
sense moral. There is no 'goody' talk and no cant, but principles of
truthfulness, integrity, and self-reliance are quietly inculcated by example.
It is safe to say that any boy will be the better for reading books like this."&mdash;<i>St.
